This stunning, spacious, elegant and rustic country property combines tranquil, private living with the convenience of being situated just a one-minute drive to La Trocha shopping centre in Coín. 

The house comprises a lovely reception area in the entrance hall. To the right is a fantastic rustic style kitchen with dining area and access to a magnificent covered porch with outside dining area.  To the left of the hallway is a superb living room with log-burning fireplace and reading area, which is perfect for comfy movie nights or for relaxing and getting lost in a good novel.

The hallway leads to 3 large bedrooms (one of which is ensuite) and shower room, followed by a staircase that takes you up to the spacious master bedroom, with small walk-in wardrobe and shower room. This bedroom also benefits from a lovely terrace with stunning views to the Sierra de las Nieves mountain range and the pool area.  The house boasts immaculate finishes and great quality building work. 

The exterior dining and seating area is great for family reunions as there is a summer kitchen with barbecue and with views to the pool area. There is also an annex, which is currently used as washing / storage area, but could easily be converted into a separate apartment if needed. 

There are solar panels for hot water, a 10,000L water tank, town water, well water and irrigation water for the plot. The majority of the land is flat.
