We have several plots for sale in the fabulous Marbella Club Golf Resort, an exclusive, private, secured and gated Resort with private golf course, restaurant and equestrian center in Benahavis.

The main concept of this resort is to keep the abundant local forest and vegetation. For this reason, the minimum plot size is 4.000 m2 and the building allowance is aproximately 10.6%. Only detached villas can be built, in two levels plus basement and terraces which do not count as building allowance. Since the plots are generally steep, the basements can have excellent views.

All plots do have nice views, some golf views, some, sea views, or forest views, or a mix of them. Anyhow, privacy and views are granted. 

The golf course, restaurant and equestrian center are attended by very professional and friendly staff which really help making this a very especial retreat. 

This plot has a total of 4.990 m2 size, meaning around 529 m2 of building allowance, plus basement and terraces. The terrain inclination of the plot is west, with a very nice panoramic view over the golf course and mountains plus some sea and Gibraltar view. Although the plot is steep, it is a corner unit which helps when it comes to optimising the use of the plot.
