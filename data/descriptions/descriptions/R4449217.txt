Great opportunity to purchase a well-established winery and to keep developing an already thriving enterprise.

This winery specializes in crafting artisanal wines and is nestled in picturesque mountains, in an area with an ideal climate and rich history of wine-growing.

The current annual production capacity ranges between 8.000 and 10.000 bottles, with a maximum annual capacity of the winery being 150 hectoliters (equivalent to 20.000 bottles). The winery also manages the labeling and bottling processes.

The facilities are well-equipped to provide tourists with an authentic wine experience, offering a laboratory within the fermentation chamber, a dedicated room for regular wine tastings, ample storage space and a barrel room. The property also comprises an apartment with a living-dining room, fully-equipped kitchen and 2 bedrooms.

The estate is connected to the grid and has its own water supply system. 

All necessary licenses are in place, which makes this property an excellent opportunity to expand a successful business with substantial growth potential.
