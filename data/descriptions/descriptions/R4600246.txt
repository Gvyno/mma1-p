Located directly on the beachside walk gives the opportunity to walk along the sea front to many restaurants and bars - walking to Estepona or Costalita is a pure delight.  

This 2 bed / 2 bath corner apartment has 2 very good size terraces which benefit from all day sun. Upon entering the apartment you will find a fully fitted kitchen with separate utility room with plenty of storage. The large lounge is full of light and has access to both terraces.

Plenty of fitted wardrobes and the en-suite bathroom has been totally renovated with a large bath and walk in shower.
