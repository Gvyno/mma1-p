Cute house with beautiful old walls, perfect for a small restoration project, this three-story house is located in the most central street of Gaucín.

The ground floor is open with a window facing the street, the first floor is currently a large open space with a separate bathroom. It has a third floor to go up with a portable ladder to a small storage area.

Excellent location and a wonderful opportunity for a project, taking advantage of the existing structure and features of the house.
