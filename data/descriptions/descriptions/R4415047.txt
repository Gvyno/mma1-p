Simply stunning apartment in a very small community of only 23 properties in the sought after area of La Cala Golf.  This modern property is only 3 years old and has hardly been used so it still feels almost brand new.  Lovely sunny lounge diner with fully fitted kitchen and access on to the south facing terrace with truly outstanding views over the gorgeous communal swimming pool and gardens to the golf course and countryside beyond.  Large main bedroom with beautiful en-suite bathroom, two more double bedrooms that share the ample guest shower room and hot and cold air conditioning throughout.  Owners also have an allocated covered parking space within the gated community
