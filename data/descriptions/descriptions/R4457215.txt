A jewel of a property found in the heart of Mijas Pueblo. The top floor apartment has been totally renovated, with new kitchen, bathroom, floors, doors and windows. The stunning views from the private terrace stretch across the village to Fuengirola and the Mediterranean Sea down below. Close to shops, restaurants, public transport and all within walking distance. Perfect property for a holiday home with good rental potential or permanent home.
