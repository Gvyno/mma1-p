Located in an iconic community set within a very short walk of both the hugely popular Mistral  Beach and the heart of Puerto Banus,this beautiful apartment is the perfect sunshine retreat or holiday investment property.

The apartment is presented in perfect condition and can be enjoyed by the new owner from day one.

The property enjoys a modern open plan lay out to the lounge and kitchen and is bathed in natural daylight due to it&apos;s appealing south westerly orientation. With two bedrooms and a newly reformed bathroom with walk in shower. Pleasant views can be enjoyed from the private terrace over the communal garden area and pool.

Viewing is highly recommended of this lovely property.
