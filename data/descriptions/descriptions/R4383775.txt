Great town house very central and ideal as an investment. The property is distributed over two floors. On the main floor there is an entrance hall, a living-dining room with air conditioning,  bathroom and a kitchen from where there is access to a very cozy  Andalusian patio  with a storage room. On this floor we also have a bedroom that could even be converted into a garage. In the upper part there is a spacious master bedroom with air conditioning and access to a private terrace, a second very bright bedroom and a spacious hall where a second bathroom could be built . Your visit is highly recommended.
