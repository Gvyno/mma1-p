La "Morera" is an impressive frontline beach urbanization which is located next to Marbella´s famous "Los Monteros" beach and just a few steps from the well-known beach restaurant Trocadero Arena. Designed by the famous Melvin Villarroel it combines timeless Mediterranean architecture with exclusive luxury. It offers 24 hours security, a pool, an indoor pool, a gym and a wonderful tropical 10.000 m2 garden. The location of this community is probably one of the best in Marbella: it has direct access to a sandy beach, no passing traffic and is still very close to golf, dining and shopping facilities. A unique opportunity that must be seen to be fully appreciated.
