NEGOTIABLE!

Amazing opportunity to buy a very old house (from 1955) in the old quarter of Benalmádena Pueblo, Málaga, which is ideal to fully reform and make a large Bed & Breakfast property, plus personal home on top.

The plot is 207sq m, and has 2 entrances from 2 parallel streets, in 2 heights. Therefore, you can build 2 floors + attic on each end.

Because of its location inside the old quarter, this plot allows you to build up to 100% of its area.

Benalmádena Pueblo is a picturesque white village on the Costa del Sol and it´s one of the most attractive areas for tourist year round. 

This house is within 200 meters from the Town-hall and all typical bars and restaurants in the old town (Pueblo). You can walk everywhere, including supermarkets, the taxi rank and bus stop-

If you´re planning to purchase a bed and breakfast (B&B) on the Costa del Sol, don´t miss this opportunity!
