Best penthouse in the complex, hands down. Stunning 3 bedroom duplex penthouse, with the trifecta of desirable views: Sea, Golf and the iconic La Concha mountain. The apartment boasts a South West orientation, with 3 terraces, giving you the opportunity to sun worship to your hearts content, or, if you prefer, benefit from the covered portions for those less enamoured with the heat. 

The apartment is part of the Royal Marbella Golf resort. A touristic property with full licence for the complex already obtained, saving your clients the hassle, cost and time taken to obtain one themselves. Fully furnished and serviced, right down to the crockery and bedsheets. Idiliq are the managing agents (30 years' experience managing over 3,500 properties across 15 territories), backed by the Marriot group (32 million members), making this an incredible investment property. With the rental market exploding on the Costa del Sol in the last year, seeing an average increase of 30%, in addition to constantly increasing demand, this is truly a fantastic opportunity. 

The property comes with 1 parking space and 1 storage room. On site facilities include a fitness centre, 2 outdoor swimming pools, sauna and steam room. There is also a café open all year around and a minimart offering your daily essentials.
