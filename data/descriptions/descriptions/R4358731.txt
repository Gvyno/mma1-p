Small single-storey country property in need of finishing, just a short distance to the town of Alhaurín El Grande, only a short drive to the local schools and amenities.

The property was built in 2012 with the purpose of a weekend and holiday getaway. It is ideal as a "lock up and go" property and is situated in a very quiet area offering some fabulous sunsets. 

You enter the building straight into the open plan living room, which then has access to two other rooms, planned on being a kitchen and bathroom, but they are not fitted.

The current owners have applied to the Town Hall for connection to the municipal water network, but at the moment there is only irrigation water for watering the plot, and fruit trees. The plot is terraced and fairly flat.
