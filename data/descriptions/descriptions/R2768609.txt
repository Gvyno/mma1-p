A large gated estate with private road consisting of 5 villas, each with their own plots and title deeds. The existing villas are in various states of repair and offer private pools and sea views. There are two modern 4/5 bed villas requiring only minor renovation - built to a high luxury standard in 2000 (never lived in) with high quality cream marble flooring and gas central heating; a third 4 bed contemporary style villa with indoor pool that requires only minor TLC; a large original 7 bed villa on an 8000 m2 plot with grand outdoor swimming pool and a huge indoor pool with spa that requires total reform + space to re-segregate the plot to build another 3 villas; and a 4 bed guest villa also in need of total renovation. This is an ideal project site for a developer or investor.
