The bright apartment on the top floor has a great floor plan without wasted squares. The living room, dining room and open kitchen form a spectacular space where you have also a fireplace. The ceiling beams are an eye-catcher. The living room is flooded with light from the sliding glass doors that lead to the sunny terrace. The large roof terrace has incredible views over the city and the mountains. The spacious kitchen is fully equipped, the appliances are new and there is plenty of counter space. The utility room is practically behind a separate door. The magnificent ceiling beams of the bright master bedroom create an atmosphere in the space, and there is also a good-sized en-suite bathroom. Both upstairs bedrooms are spacious and there is plenty of storage space. Two stylish bathrooms add to the smoothness of everyday life.

The apartment includes a spacious parking space in the parking garage and a storage room.

The apartment is located on the top, fourth floor of the housing complex. There is no elevator in the housing community, but there has been discussion about building one.

The location of the apartment is most excellent, the beautiful center of Alhaurin El Grande, comprehensive services and excellent restaurants can be found within walking distance. Malaga airport is only 35 minutes away.
