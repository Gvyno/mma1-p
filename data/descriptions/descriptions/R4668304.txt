This stunning Andalucian style country house is a rare find. It offers a very spacious living area with over 2 acres of flat land and is less than 5 minutes to the town of Alhaurín el Grande.

This beautiful property has been lovingly reformed in a rustic style but with modern high-quality finishes. In the main house you enter a large open plan living area via a covered terrace. From here you have different exits to the mature gardens. From the living room there is access to the open plan kitchen with dining area where you have a great space to cook and entertain family and guests. Also from the living room is access to a double bedroom and shower room. From the entrance hall are stairs to 2 more very spacious bedrooms and another shower room. As you leave the living room onto the courtyard you then have access to 3 very large bedrooms; 2 are ensuite and one has a dressing room.

Opposite the main house is the annex, which has been converted into living space, with a beautiful living room, 2 further bedrooms and a shower room. Outside there are various areas to enjoy the best of country living. The pool is adjacent to the terrace from the living room, which makes it perfect for cooling down on summer day. 

The property is a dream for horse owners as there is stabling for 3 horses, a 75-meter by 25-meter picadero as well as another separate training arena. There are 3 separate water supplies one from the town and also its own well as well as irrigation water. This is indeed a remarkable country property and one that needs to be seen to be truly appreciated.
