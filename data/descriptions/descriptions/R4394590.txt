Interesting TWO in ONE !

I would like to introduce you to this beautiful and very interesting finca, comprising 2 plots which, although linked by the lush pool area, each have their own entrance and are in an enclosed urbanization in the green heart of Alhaurín de la Torre.

On the first plot of just over 2'000 m2, there is a surprising Mediterranean style house on 2 floors, with double glazed windows protected by grilles from an old convent, with door frames and stained-glass windows with history and each of the rooms offers an escape in time thanks to its elegant decoration, not forgetting the Roman columns at the entrance to the property.
The ground floor is distributed in 2 living rooms (1 with fireplace), 1 dining room, 1 very spacious kitchen, 1 bedroom with bathroom in suite, 1 toilet and a hall, from which you access the upper floor.
This first floor consists of 4 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms, 2 of which are in suite, a hallway, and an open terrace.
Outside, the lawns, fruit trees and other trees and flowers in this peaceful setting are generously watered by the property's private well, which also has covered parking for one car.

The second plot of 1'192 m2, also flat, is a great opportunity to have a second totally independent house.

The Finca is only a few minutes' walk to the village, with a wide variety of shops, restaurants, bars, health centers, schools and a 10-minute drive to Málaga, the airport and the first beach.

Don't hesitate to call me to arrange a visit! - SR1
