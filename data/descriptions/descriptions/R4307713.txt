It is 420m2 and it is possible to build a property of 109m2. Great access to the A-107 and the toll road. The village of Mijas is a short 5 minute drive and has many restaurants. Also a 10 minute drive from Fuengirola and it's beautiful bars and restaurants and of course the beach. A great choice when deciding upon a place to build your perfect house.
