The apartement has a new kitchen with a separate laudryroom, a big and bright living and diningroom that lead you to the cosy terrace with some seaviews. 
It has 3 big bedrooms and one is with a beautiful bathroom ensuite. Two of them has a french balcony and the other leads to the cosy terrace as well. You also have an another new bathroom with bathtube.
The complex has a beautiful communal pool area as well and a storage room. 
The location is great due to the proximity to the beach and all amenities. You can easy walk to the beach or enjoy a good meal at many of the restaurants near the property.
A perfect place for holiday or a permanent living!
