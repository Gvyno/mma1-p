Detached villa in Estepona with views to the Strait of Gibraltar.

 It consists of 3 floors distributed as follows:

Ground floor with living room, kitchen, toilet and large porch that is accessed directly from the living room. The first floor houses 2 bathrooms and 3 bedrooms, one of them with an en-suite bathroom and a large dressing room. The basement, where the garage is located, with an area of about 65 m2, has capacity for 2 vehicles. It is a perfect space to take out one or two more bedrooms since light enters through windows and it also has one  bedroom, one toilet and one laundry room.
On the roof we find a fabulous terrace-solarium with splendid views of the Mediterranean Sea and the Strait of Gibraltar.

The villa was renovated by the owner in order to obtain a more spacious house. Space was gained for the dining room located in the living room by closing part of the porch, what was finally achieved is a larger living room and dining room with much more light than the house originally had.

The grass garden has its own pool.
