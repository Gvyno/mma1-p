AN AMAZING INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY!!!
Thank you for considering this investment opportunity in Estepona! This property boasts 3 bedrooms, 1.5 bathrooms, a rooftop terrace, and a garage located in the heart of Estepona. One of the most attractive features of the property is its stunning views, which are sure to impress both visitors and residents alike. In addition to the living spaces, the garage adds 99 square meters of space to the property, which could be used for a variety of purposes.

One potential use for the garage space is to offer it as a rental for highly sought-after parking spaces in the area. Another option would be to divide the current property into two or three individual townhouses, each with its own parking space, ground floor, and solarium. These options provide flexibility for the property's use and could increase its overall value.
