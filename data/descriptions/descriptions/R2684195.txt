A beautiful bright and airy 3 bedroom flat in one of the most popular urbanisations in the centre of Marbella. 
A stone throw from the beach with shops, bars and numerous restaurants just outside your front door.
The apartment is in a quiet area of the urbanisation facing west with afternoon sun and terrace facing the pool and lovely mature gardens. 
It is also interesting for an investor since it easily could be converted into 2 apartments and become a great rental investment.
Easy viewings, keys in office.
