Unique opportunity for a developer/ investor!

A very spacious 332m2 detached Andalusian style villa on Mijas Golf, one of only a few that has sea views, and sits on a plot of 3,733m2

The villa is being sold with an extra building plot. 2 building plots in total. One plot can be sold on for a profit for somebody to build their own villa or develop the plot themselves to build a separate villa. 

Both plots are already legally separated and are registered on the catastral with 2 separate driveways already built. 

The villa is in need of some renovation work which is obviously reflected by its very low price.

The villa which has 4 bedrooms and 5 bathrooms is built over 3 floors including a large basement.

You enter the villa via a large Andalucian style patio and parking area. 

From the main entrance there is a large kitchen that has a beautiful breakfast veranda eating area with French doors leading to the garden.

To the right of the entrance hall is a large lounge with an open fire and French doors leading out onto a terrace and the garden.

On this ground floor level are 2 double bedrooms both en-suite and further bedroom and a guest toilet. 

The large luminous master en-suite bedroom is on the first floor. French doors lead out onto a terrace with great south facing views.

From the ground floor you have access to a large basement, with lots of light, and its own full bathroom. 

In the south facing gardens, there is a pool, lawned areas, terraces and a bbq area.

The villa is set away from the road so it is very peaceful and quiet.
