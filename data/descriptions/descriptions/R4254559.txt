Beautiful large plot of land with panoramic views of the Guadalhorce Valle, just a short drive to La Trocha shopping centre in Coin.

The easily accessible fenced plot has large flat areas next to the lane then slopes down the valley. It's primarily full of olive trees and a small fruit orchard. 

Current legislation permits the building of a 65m2 agricultural property. Water & electricity close by but not connected.
