Authentic Finca with lots of potential in rural area. The finca is located on the countryside and yet only 10 minutes drive from the beach and the shops in La Cala. The exceptional big plot of over 13000 square meters is in rural area and is partially fenced, to plant olive trees or keep horses. The house has at this point a fully equipped kitchen, living room and 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. Another room can be accessed from the outside. By adding a fully covered terrace in front of the house the usable are could almost double.  On the plot there is also a separate building of 24 square meters that could be transformed into guesthouse of garage. Around the house there is plenty of space to add a pool if required.
