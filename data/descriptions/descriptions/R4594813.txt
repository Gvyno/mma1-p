Introducing an exquisite, newly constructed villa nestled within a secure gated community, a mere five-minute drive from the town and beach. This opulent community features a club house, spa, gym, lush Mediterranean gardens, and breathtaking panoramic sea views.

Situated as a corner property, the villa offers maximum tranquility at the lower part of the residence. Spanning two levels with an additional mezzanine floor, the entrance is adorned with a welcoming porch. The main entrance, positioned on the upper floor, serves as the focal level of the house. Upon entering, a grand open-plan living space unfolds, characterized by high ceilings and expansive windows that usher in abundant natural light. This space includes a fully equipped kitchen with Siemens appliances, a spacious salon, a dining room, and a convenient guest toilet. The living areas seamlessly extend to expansive terraces covered by a pergola, leading to the verdant gardens and a delightful swimming pool. On one side of the villa, the master bedroom, complete with an ensuite bathroom, offers a tranquil retreat. On the opposite side of the foyer, a broad staircase ascends to the mezzanine floor, revealing two additional bedrooms sharing a communal bathroom. The bathrooms feature fittings by Villeroy & Boch and taps by Grohe.

This captivating project is scheduled for completion in 2024, promising an exciting blend of luxury and modern living.
