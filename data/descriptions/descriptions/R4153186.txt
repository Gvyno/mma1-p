In the well known urbanization Tio Charles, we present this beautifully refurbished and furnished flat with two bedrooms and two bathrooms.

It is located in a very well communicated area, with easy access to the motorway and close to tourist attractions such as the Mariposario de Benalmádena, the Stupa and the Colomares Castle.

The modern kitchen, recently tastefully renovated, has good quality appliances.

At the entrance of the property there is a convenient parking space, included in the price.

The gated residential community benefits from a swimming pool, a well maintained garden area as well as mountain views.

The flat has a tourist licence, which makes it very attractive for those who are thinking of investing in the area and getting a good economic return.
