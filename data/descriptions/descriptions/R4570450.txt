Fabulous property located in the same Puerto de Cabopino, with fantastic views of the sea!!!

It consists of two properties that were joined to create a spacious, comfortable and very bright space.

From the large en-suite bedroom with dressing room, you can see the sea and enjoy views of the common areas of the Port.

Large living room, American kitchen. Southeast facing terrace.

This apartment offers great potential because it has the possibility of creating a third bedroom with a window and expanding the terrace (extension approved by the community).

High quality materials have been used for its renovation.

Included in the price is 2 underground private parking spaces, plus the community parking area.

In the Port you can enjoy two swimming pools, one of which has direct access to the beach!
