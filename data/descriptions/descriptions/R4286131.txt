Stunning 3 bedroom ground floor apartment in Les Belvederes, a well maintained community with a communal pool, 2 tennis courts and lake Pantano Viejo Del Angel just around the corner.

Perfect for people who like to be on the outskirts - away from the hustle and bustle of Puerto Banus with the opportunity for peaceful hikes yet also a short drive into the port.

The apartment is distributed across one level with an open plan brand new kitchen and a high quality wooden floor running through the space into a bright living room with opening glass doors onto the terrace.

The large South facing terrace of 50 m2 has a built-in jacuzzi and barbecue area, closed and private for you to enjoy the sun throughout the day, perfect in the summer and colder months of the year in Marbella.

Lastly you have 3 bedrooms, one luxurious master with an en-suite bathroom and a walk-in wardrobe, and an additional 2 for children or guests with a guest toilet.

Great full time or holiday home for a couple or a family, especially with a pet.

Furnitures included in the price  ( €‎ 50.000 ).
