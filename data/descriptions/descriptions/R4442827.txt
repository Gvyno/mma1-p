This lovely presented and almost fully refurbished charming villa gives you a immediate "good feeling" the moment you walk in. You enter in the living/dining area with attached the modern open kitchen. On the right is a large master bedroom with wardrobe area and en suite bathroom with a separate shower. The other two bedrooms share one family shower room. The property has a large wrap around garden with a lot of terrace space. There is also a separate utility room but in need of some finishing. This combined with the fact that you can walk to bars, restaurants, shops and beach makes it a very desirable holiday or permanent residence. Furthermore there is a good size community pool.
