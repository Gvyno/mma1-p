This fantastic 3 bedroom apartment in the center of Marbella is located on the fourth floor of a boutique building with only one apartment per floor, which makes it very exclusive. Located on the main avenue of Marbella, opposite the famous Alameda Park, from the terrace we enjoy beautiful views of the treetops and thanks to its south orientation it has sun all day, which makes the rooms light and bright.

The property is currently used as part of the facilities of a clinic, so the future owner will need to do some renovation to bring it up to conventional housing standards.

The apartment has a large living room with huge windows, kitchen, three bedrooms and two bathrooms, plus a balcony - terrace overlooking the park. On the top floor of the building there is a large communal solarium terrace for private use of the owners.

Whether as an investment or as a permanent home, this apartment for sale in Marbella is fabulous thanks to its location close to the Plaza de los Naranjos, the beach, the port of La Bajadilla and all the boutiques and services of the cosmopolitan city of Marbella.
