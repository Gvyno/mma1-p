Cornerhouse well located in Villas y Golf with a communal pool and 24-hour security. The property, meticulously maintained, is equipped with all the comforts you can imagine. 
The layout is simply perfect: an entrance hall leading to a spacious living room with a dining area and a cozy open fireplace. From here, you have access to a terrace-garden that takes you to a private oasis. The separate kitchen and utility room add a practical and functional element. On the ground floor, you'll find a bedroom with built-in wardrobes and a renovated bathroom from 2020 with a shower and toilet. Go up the stairs to the first floor and immerse yourself in the luxury of the master bedroom with built-in wardrobes, a luxurious en-suite bathroom with underfloor heating (renovated in 2020), and an open terrace. Bedrooms 3 and 4 also share a bathroom with underfloor heating, also renovated in 2020. This home is not only stylish but also sustainable, with solar panels for hot water, Samsung air conditioning (hot-cold), and a cozy open fireplace in the living room. The exterior is equally impressive, with a spacious carport for 2 cars and additional space for bicycles, scooters, or even a jet ski. The private garden and partially covered terrace with a wooden pergola are perfect for outdoor enjoyment. 
"Villas and Golf" is a community where families reside year-round, with detached and semi-detached houses built between 2003 and 2004. The neighbourhood, located next to the popular Guadalmina Golf Course, offers a communal pool, beautiful gardens, and sports facilities. Although this house does not have a view of the golf course, the proximity to the charming village of San Pedro (a 20-minute walk) and the popular Centro Comercial Guadalmina (2 km away) makes it even more attractive. With excellent access to the A7 and N340 highways, you can reach the center of Marbella in just 15 minutes by car and Malaga Airport in 40 minutes. Don't miss the chance to make this house your new home!
