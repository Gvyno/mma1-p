A unique opportunity to purchase and improve a well located, large sized and easily accessible property in the hills of Valtocado.   With consideration and investment, the property could become a modern classic.  The views, position and surrounding neighbouring properties are all grade A.   This is a must see and for those who have visited or often longed for the Los Angeles hill type properties, this could be the one for you.   

This three-bedroom, two-bathroom property is ideally situated and boasts stunning views of the immediate valley, mountains, surrounding forest, backed with sea and coastline views beyond.  There are multiple terraces surrounding what could be an infinity pool with additional sunbathing areas.  There is an outdoor fireplace with seating and dining area conveniently located off the lounge.      

In addition, there is a separate family or live-in accommodation apartment below consisting of two connected studio apartments.  Externally, the property has several areas for car parking with potential to extend the hard standing and possibly to build a garage.    Overall, the property is secure and private.  

Whilst the building does require updates and modernisation, originally, the property was well built and thought out.  You can live and update as required or take on a reform project before moving in.   The property is priced with the works taken into consideration.  

The opportunity to update the property into a stunning family residence is unmatched.  We recommend early viewing to fully understand the potential on offer
