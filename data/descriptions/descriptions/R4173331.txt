Opportunity - Plot with Townhouse Project and License in Centre Estepona.

Right in the heart of Estepona with all the amenities the village offers you in a typical well kept and quaint street with orange trees.
Design and license are available and you can still make some changes. 

The design consist of the groundfloor with a garage, a bathroom and access to the elevator that runs to the top floor.
On the first floor we have the living room and kitchen dining room with guest toilet and terrace. On the second floor we have the 3 bedrooms with 1 bathroom and a terrace.

If you go ahead with the existing design it should take around 8 months to complete thjs lovely Townhouase. A great opportunity to be right in the middle of Town with your own parking.
