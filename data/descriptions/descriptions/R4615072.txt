This is a cosy first floor apartment with superb sea views at Princesa Kristina, Duquesa.

Princesa Kristina is an established, yet peaceful, hillside complex with 2 large swimming pools and well maintained gardens.  It is only a 15 minute walk down to the sandy beach and beach bars.  A further 15 minute walk along the beach takes you to the lively marina of La Duquesa.  In addition, a 5 minute drive takes you to the seaside town of Sabinillas, complete with shops, supermarkets, tapas bars and restaurants.

This Princesa Kristina apartment is accessed via a staircase to the first floor.  There is a super 10m2 terrace on entrance with stunning views of the sea and surrounding coast. The living room is spacious with an open plan kitchen.  The shower room is a good size and has been tastefully modernized.  The bedroom is large and with fitted wardrobes.

The property could benefit with some further minor modernizing, but not essential.

This is a charming first floor apartment with exceptional views and would make a fabulous little holiday home.  Furthermore, the running costs are low.

Princesa Kristina has excellent links to Estepona and Marbella, whilst Gibraltar and Malaga Airports are less than 30 mins and an hour away respectively.
