This cozy home is located a few minutes to all the services of Centro Plaza, Puerto Banus, bars and cafes. It is the ideal holiday home where you dont need a car or as a permanent home in the best location.
The exstensive gardens are beautful and well kept and the apartment beeing on a ground floor has got easy access to the pool and gardens.
All the 3 bedrooms and the living room and kitchen are on one level. Two of the bedrooms have en-suite bathrooms and one bedroom has got a seperate bathroom. The kitchen is half open. The property could do with some renovation and an option would be to integrate one of the bedrooms ( that has no window ) into the livingroom. It is a bright property with a good size terrace that has just been renovated. All the bedrooms and livingroom have got new AC split units.
A lovely home with great potential.
