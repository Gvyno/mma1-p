Resale villa. Situated close to amenities, shops and restaurants, only a 9 minute drive from the beach and a 14 minute walk from amenities, restaurants and supermarkets, this stunning villa has never been lived in. 

Built in 2021 to an extremely high standard, this resale property is distributed on 3 levels with living spaces that are open plan, making it perfect to entertain. This includes a large dining area and integrated kitchen fitted with high-end appliances. The spacious roof terrace has open views and offers extra space for entertaining.

There is underfloor heating and air conditioning throughout the villa. Other features include large windows from floor to ceiling, that open out onto water features, terraces and swimming pool. 

Another fantastic feature is the basement with natural light, that has the possibility to build further bedrooms, a gym, a cinema, or a games room alongside the spacious 2 car garage.

Only a short drive from Puerto Banus and Marbella and the traditional town of San Pedro de Alcantara, and close to some well esteemed international schools, this villa would make an ideal permanent family residence or holiday home.
