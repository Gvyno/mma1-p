A traditional country house to reform close to the Rio Grande on the border of Coin & Guaro.

The house on two levels comprises ground floor with living room, kitchen, dining room, bedroom and storeroom. Upstairs are two large rooms which can be converted to included additional bedrooms and a bathroom. 

The property consists of 3 plots of 12579 m2, 3670 m2 and 1608 m2, each with their own escritura. The land runs down to the valley, there are some fruit trees but mainly with productive olive trees. Outside there is an outside kitchen, a water deposit/pool, and parking for several cars. It has its own well with the possibility to connect to town water. 

The property is in need of complete renovation internally. Registered as a vivienda on the deeds but it does not have the  AFO. As the property was built in the 50's this would be a formality but would be the new owners responsibility.

Very good access from the main road, located 10 minutes drive from Coin and Guaro. Good communication to Marbella with access via Monda in 30 minutes.
