A fantastic and well maintained townhouse - with the feeling of a detached villa - located in the residential area of Bel-Air on the east side of Estepona. This property would make a wonderful family home and has been lovingly cared for and looked after by its current owners. The property consists of four bedrooms, three and a half bathrooms and has a lovely outdoor terrace area as well as a small roof terrace. There are sea views from the master bedroom and its accompanying terrace, all of which face South. Located on a small community, there is the possibility to add your own private pool, just as the surrounding owners have done. There is also private off street parking and the community is completely gated.
