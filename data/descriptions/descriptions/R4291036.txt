Beautiful apartment with sea and mountain views in Torreblanca!
Beautiful apartment with two terraces, located in a fantastic urbanization with two pools and garden, just 5 minutes drive to the city center, 1 km to the train station in Torreblanca and just over 1 km to the beach. There is a local shuttle bus in the area leaving and arriving to/from the city center every 15 minutes.  

It consists of an entrance hall, an independent fully equipped kitchen, a spacious living/dining room, 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, one of which is ensuite. A private terrace in the south-west/west position with sea view where you can enjoy sun in the afternoon until sunset. The floor on the terrasse is updated with a sophisticated wood material. There is a patio in the other direction perfect for those who love to grill. The kitchen is equipped with water distillation and the hot water heater has been changed into a newer and more effective heater. Adjacent to the house there is a common garden for the six apartments in this house with flower beds where you can grove your own herbs for example and a large area for socializing. Free parking in the parking lot outside the house or on the street. 

The apartment is in Torreblanca among the hills with views of both sea and mountains. If you dream of peace, of being able to walk around in a green oasis, hear the birds singing, read a book undisturbed by the pool, this is something for you! The urbanization is very special given the large and well-kept garden and two different pool areas.
