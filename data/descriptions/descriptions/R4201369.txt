A rare opportunity to acquire an exceptionally well presented 1 bed room, 2 bathroom, ground floor apartment in White Pearl Beach. Exclusive listing. This spacious 1 bed room apartment has been totally transformed into a classy suite, which would not be out of place in any 5 star hotel.

On entering, to the right there is a guest w/c and shower room. The hall extends to an impressive fully equipped, open plan fitted kitchen with an integrated dining area. The lounge is a generous size enjoying plenty natural light and leads out to the private terrace and garden. The feature wall includes an inset television and classy effect fire place and to the right decorative inset glass shelving continuing the kitchen theme.

The bedroom which looks out to the terrace is of ample size and has a separate offset dressing area and a uniquely designed en-suite shower room. All of the fixture and fittings throughout are of high quality, made to measure and installed to exacting standards. The property is sold fully furnished (less certain personal effects) and the whole apartment exudes class.

It will make a superb holiday home, or high yield generating rental investment as there is a touristic licence in place that can be transferred to a new owner.

White Pearl Beach is a highly sought after, well managed, beach front community in Elvria with well-maintained tropical gardens and a large swimming pool. It's a 30 second stroll to the best golden sandy beaches of Marbella and the nearest chiringuito. Within a 5 minutes' walk you have the Elviria commercial centres with a plethora of shops, bars and restaurants.
