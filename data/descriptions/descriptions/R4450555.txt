Lovely 2-3 bedroom penthouse in a tranquil community with pool in Colinas de Faro in Mijas Costa.
The apartment has two bedrooms, one of which has a French balcony. Both bedrooms have fitted wardrobes. There is also a third room, which could be used as a study, library or a guest bedroom. There is one bathroom in the apartment. The living room is spacious and has two big windows opening to a large covered terrace, with class curtains. The southwest facing terrace has a lovely view over the roof tops all the way to the sea and mountains. There is an open kitchen with an island in the middle, with both electric and gas hobs. The kitchen is fully fitted and the apartment is sold furnished.
The gated community has a lovely swimming pool area with a mature garden and there is also parking space within the gated community. There is a nice restaurant next door to the community, so you do not have to take the car always when going out for a dinner. The location is very good and the lovely town of Cala de Mijas is only 8min drive away. The distance to Fuengirola is less than 4km and the drive to the Malaga Airport takes only 20mins.
