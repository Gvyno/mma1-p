Highly motivated owner, reduced Fantastic 3 bed, 2 bath luxury newly built/renovated apartment in Manilva, with both sea and mountain view.  

A great location to enjoy the fabulous nearby beaches, town and nature. The apartment is sold fully furnished and has barely been used by the owners so it is just like new. This is an apartment that you can just walk into and enjoy for private use or as an immediate investment opportunity as the existing rental properties in the development have been booked out all summer and are in high demand.
 It&apos;s equipped with absolutely everything you might need. 

The 3 bedrooms are spacious, light and modern and each has plenty of storage space. Close to supermarkets and golf courses so ideal for use all year round and just 20 minutes to Puerto Banus. Residents can enjoy the manicured communal gardens, pools, sports facilities, co-working zone and clubhouse. Coming soon there will be a bus service to the local marina area of La Duquesa port adding even more appeal to this great value-for-money apartment, plus the resort will boast a very special chiringuito/beach bar for residents only to enjoy all year round.
