Amazing opportunity to live in this Countryside Finca/Villa yet only 1.5 kilometers to Mercadona at La Cala de Mijas and 1.9 Kilometers to the beach.
Nestled in the countryside next to a forest this lovely property is fully fenced and gated and  includes a self contained one bedroom apartment for friends or family or indeed an added income.
The main house is reached by a sweeping drive through double electric gates, the access to the house is up eight steps into a short hall and we have a fully fitted kitchen to the left and the lounge to the right with access through to the bedroom area. On this floor you have two bedrooms and a family bathroom. Stairs lead up to a 65m2 terrace and a very large master bedroom which is ensuite and has its own dressing area and delightful views over the countryside.
Returning to the outside of the property you have access to the very good sized Apartment which includes a large lounge with fitted kitchen, a very good sized double bedroom with fully fitted shower room/bathroom..
You also have some underbuild areas used for tool room, well house and storage, at the moment the current owners use their own water supply but we are told that you can connect to the community water which is available. The property has a 10,000 litre deposit with two smaller filtered storages of around 600 litres each. The present owners have also installed 24 solar panels, central heating which can run on both the Gas and Oil supplies and boilers.
The grounds include a heated swimming pool , patio area and BBQ/Bar area. Most of the trees are mature olives on terraced slopes and some of the areas have irrigation pipes .
It is very unusual to find a country property so close to amenities and the beach, even more so when it is the La Cala de Mijas area
