This ground floor apartment with a completely enclosed private garden enjoys the entire southwest corner of the building where it is located, which makes it especially bright and private.

Inside, we find a bedroom, bathroom and a  fully equipped kitchen, open to the living room. Being a corner apartment, the lay out of the property is different from the others, it also offers extra meters, and more storage space compared to the standard apartment. All the original exterior carpentry has been replaced with double glazed windows and doors and an air conditioning machine has been installed in the living room.

Through its main terrace facing south, we access its L-shaped, completely closed garden, which surrounds the property on its south and west sides, allowing two independent areas. Garden maintenance is included in community fees and is carried out by community gardeners.

The apartment has a privileged location within the complex, close to all shops and within walking distance of the beach and the Golf.

Ideal for a couple or a person on holiday or as a permanent residence.
