Large living room with access to the backyard with morning sun and views of the park.

On the second floor we currently find 2 bedrooms, 1 bathroom with a bathtub, a dressing room and 1 open space.
Originally this open space was two more bedrooms, with a total of 4 bedrooms, the current owner opened the space to create a second living room, but two more bedrooms can easily be created again.
Where the dressing room is currently located, the master bedroom's en-suite bathroom was originally located.
