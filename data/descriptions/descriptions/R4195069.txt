Beautifully presented Townhouse very close to Marbella centre.
3 good sized bedrooms with the master bedroom having an en-suite bathroom.
The house has undergone a very high quality refurbishment and is an ideal family home, with a 2 minute walk to Swans School. The beach and town centre is only 10 mins on foot.
El Capricho is a very well maintain Urbanisation with lovely gardens and communal pool.
Viewing is highly recommended.
