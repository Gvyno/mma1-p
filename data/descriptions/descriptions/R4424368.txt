Reformation opportunity in a great location in Bel Air. Easy road access to the Coastal N340 nestled between Estepona and Marbella just off the New Golden Mile. Shops, bars, restaurants and supermarkets are walking distance from this house and there are many International schools close by such as Atlas American School, Estepona International and much more making it a good property for a family.

The property was constructed in 1996 and has had the same owners who now reluctantly are selling. You enter a pedestrian gate into a nice front garden laid with grass and you have a nice West facing covered terrace. You will find on this level the main living and dining room, an office space, a very large kitchen which could easily be integrated into the living area by removing a wall, and a guest WC. Upstairs on floor 1 you will find a bedroom with en-suite and access to a terrace and 2 further bedrooms, one of which has access to the terrace and a family bathroom. Up another level to the 2nd floor you will find the master bedroom with a dressing room and a large ensuite and access to a very large terrace with views of La Concha and the sea. 

This property also has a basement which is accessed from the front garden down some stairs and here you will find a large garage with a kitchen, and a self contained unit with a kitchenette, shower room and own access which makes it ideal for guests or staff accommodation. In addition there is lots of storage space in this area. From this level you have outside the garage a very large area for your exclusive use and a path leads to the communal gardens and swimming pools where you will find 2 large pools and 1 childs pool. 

There is so much potential with this house due to the size and spaciousness of this accommodation. The current owners closed in the covered terrace so you can benefit from over 320m2 of living accomodation. 

A real opportunity to make a beautiful family home.
