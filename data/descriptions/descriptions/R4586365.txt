Cozy semi-detached house completely refurbished located in a very quiet and comfortable area to live, just 2 minutes walking from the centre of the village.
On the ground floor, from the street we have direct access to a comfortable living room, a large kitchen equipped with all the necessities and a small toilet taking advantage of the stairwell.
On the first floor, we have a large double bedroom with a large window, two single bedrooms and a complete bathroom.
Upstairs, with access from the ground floor through a door next to the kitchen, we can enjoy a large sunny terrace with a barbecue area ideal for enjoying the sun during the winter months and cozy summer evenings al fresco, small toilet to avoid having to go downstairs if we need to make use of it.
The property also has a separate laundry room and a small storage room.
