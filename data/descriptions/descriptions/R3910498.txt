This is a super opportunity for someone that wants to take on a project, middle in the village this is a townhouse with a construction at the moment of 80M2 on one level, know that you can do 4 levels here in total, that means 320M2 of property (4 apartments). It also touches both streets and is a long property, this property is an older property and last time parcially renovated over 20 years ago. It has a basement that is now closed down, but could be opened again and it has at this moment 3 bedrooms, 1 bathroom, fireplace, patio, fitted kitchen and a gorgeous and spacious terrace, though saying this, there are loads of possibilities and we think it needs preferably a full renovation. This could be 1 or several properties in the heart of the village, next to the school, swimming pool, playgrounds, doctor and all other facilities. Living here you do not need to have a car. Manilva is beautiful, modern, bit stil authentic village easy to reach from the tollroad and famous for its grapes and wine. Let us know if you have questions or would like to arrange a visit. We can assist the whole project and have a great architect and builders that can do the work, if you have the vision, we  have the tools!
