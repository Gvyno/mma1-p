This is a very unique opportunity to purchase an elite home in the heart of Málaga's historic center, but yet away from all the noise of city life.

The house was rebuilt 10 years ago upholding a very high design and construction standards sparing no detail. Its location is highly exclusive and desirable. A rare find in one of Malaga's few pedestrian squares with beautiful all-year green vertical gardens and wonderful city views from the rooftop. 

A typical Andalusian entrance welcomes you with 3 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms ensuite. There is also a tiled indoor patio with a fountain and plants to have a drink and relax from a busy day.

On the first floor you will find the livingroom with a fireplace, dining area and high-end kitchen with all appliances. High windows and skylight gives the space a warm natural light for your cooking time and dining events.

The last 3 rooms you will find on the next floor, where the current owners have their master bedroom, walk in closet and bathroom ensuite, office and a spareroom. 
High ceilings, original moldings and doors bring plenty of old charm to the comfort of modern living.

The best part of this singular home is upstairs, where the big private roof top has a fantastic view over the city and towards the cathedral with two separate sitting areas among fruit trees and local plants. 

Throughout the whole house there is underfloor heating on water for both heating and cooling.
It is prepared for a lift to be installed in the house if needed.

The owner rents a parking spot nearby the house for 130€ per month.

The house is impeccable, a rare jewel ready to move in, with all licenses in place and registrations. It could be your grand family home or dream exclusive B&B in the historic center of Málaga.
