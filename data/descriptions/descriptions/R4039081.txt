Rustic plot of land with a 176m² storehouse in ruins and an 87m² house, located in the area of El Quinto (Alhaurín El Grande). The property has great potential but needs a complete reform of the existing buildings to make it habitable. 

The total plot of 19.853m² is comprised of three individual plots divided by a road. 

The plot where the house is located measures 7,776m², the second 8,922m², and the third piece of land measures 3,155m².

There is very good access to the property, good orientation, mains electricity and private well water.

Great potential, good location, and is ideal for golf lovers. Within walking distance to restaurants and the bus stop.
