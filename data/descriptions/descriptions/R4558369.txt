The cottage of your dreams exists, and it's in Benahavís, specifically in Montemayor. The first impression upon entering the development is one of calmness, of being in nature in a peaceful and secure space. Later, upon reaching the Heredia de Montemayor, we immerse ourselves in a small village of charming cottages that make us feel at home, as if in a fairy tale.

Our home is located on the front corner facing the sea, with a south/southwest orientation, allowing you to fully enjoy a spectacular panoramic view of the sea and mountains. The balcony is literally in the countryside, merging the feelings of shelter with freedom and well-being.

The townhouse, built in 2006, and a built size of 231 square meters, features at its entrance a 150-square-meter terrace/garden, including a delightful pool and a covered terrace through which you enter the property, instantly feeling at ease. You have to experience it. A spacious living room with views and a fireplace, next to the charming kitchen, a guest toilet, and storage spaces. Additionally, on this floor, there is a bedroom with access to the pool and a full bathroom.

Heading up to the second floor via a beautiful wooden staircase, you'll find two bedrooms with exterior access, stunning views, ample closets, and full bathrooms in each room. A large terrace overlooking greenery and the blue sea is the finishing touch to this beautiful property, perfect for nature and peace enthusiasts. 

The property also includes a garage and storage room. What are you waiting for? Come see it for yourself!
