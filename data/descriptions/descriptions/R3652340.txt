Even it's only a 3 minute walk from the church, plaza and bars, this house is tucked away in a tranquil, hidden, safe alley. 

It is an authentic Andalusian townhouse, with thick walls, rustic elements and looking out onto the hills. 

Via the front door you walk into the kitchen with dining area. 
A metal spiral staircase leads you to the bedroom with ensuite bathroom. 
Then the staircase goes further to a cosy and light lounge area. 
To, then, finish with a roof top terrace large enough to dine or relax. 

That division means you have a floor for every season, when you either want to escape the heat and harsh light, or would right want to catch it. 

The house does come with an "almacen" or storage shed further in the same alley. 

Mind that you are in between the old castle/church on top and the river at the bottom, thus in world of narrow, steep alleys. The small grocery stores of the village do do deliveries, on a moped or by foot. 
An advantage is that you are literally only one minute away from that stream and a path leading into the hills of the National Park, a paradise for bird watchers and hikers. 
All in all it's a village spot with a countryside feel: very nice as bolt hole.
