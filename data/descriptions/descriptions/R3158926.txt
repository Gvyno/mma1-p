Fantastic finca that we found between the towns Alhaurín and Coín. With very easy access by road, the property has a very large main house and two other guest houses ideal for rent or use as a bed and breakfast. 

With a private pool and garden that can be used by the three houses and a large plot of land with fruit trees. 

The house has a very easy acces from the road and it is only minutes from the villages and all amenities and from the motorway and the new Hospital.

Ideal to live in the countryside and enjoy the peace and tranquility.
