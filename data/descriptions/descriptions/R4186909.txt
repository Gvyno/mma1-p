Las Jacarandas is a gated community within Los Arqueros Golf & Country Club. Qualities are as would be expected from a Taylor Woodrow build and include fully fitted wardrobes, fitted kitchen with Bosch appliances and cream marble floors.

The apartments and penthouses are situated within beautiful landscaped gardens and benefit from two communal pools (one with disabled access) and a separate children's pool. Every property has an underground parking place with optional storerooms available and there is lift access to all apartments and all within easy reach of shops and the town of San Pedro de Alcantara.

Located just minutes from Marbella, the world famous Puerto Banus and the traditional Spanish town of San Pedro de Alcantara and set amongst the foothills of Sierra de Ronda, Los Arqueros Golf & Country Club offers a combination of spectacular surrounding scenery, open spaces and exceptional views over the Mediterranean sea. 

Los Arqueros is more than an urbanization, made up of a collection of individual "villages" each with their own unique style. Apartments, town houses, villas are spread around the sleek green fairways of the Sevi Ballesteros-designed 18-hole course. High quality prevails in each of the Taylor Wimpey-built properties. High-spec kitchens, sizeable terraces, gardens and pools are just some of the benefits within each. Whatever your taste or requirement, your needs will be met with attention to detail afforded at every opportunity. 

Los Arqueros Golf & Country Club, as its name suggests, provides more than a challenging course with stunning surrounds. Other great facilities, such as the tennis, paddle & squash courts, gym, driving range, Pro shop, 2 restaurants, bar and Sport bar with ten-pin all on site.
