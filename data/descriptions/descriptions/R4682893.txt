Nice apartment, located on the second floor WITHOUT A LIFT (elevator) in a building with six neighbours, offering a perfect combination of comfort in a prime location.

Upon entering, you will be greeted by a beautiful hall that leads you to a spacious living-dining room, illuminated by natural light coming through two balconies overlooking the street. This area is ideal for family gatherings.

The property features three cosy bedrooms, a fully fitted kitchen, and a functional utility room. Additionally, it has a guest WC and a full bathroom with a spacious shower.

By no means least, the building's shared roof terrace is cleared divided, so that each neighbour has their own storage unit and a designated area to enjoy the outdoors and panoramic views. Imagine spending summer evenings there, having a barbecue with friends or simply admiring the landscape.

With a prime location, you are just a stone's throw away from all the amenities that Alhaurín El Grande has to offer, from shops and restaurants to schools and much more. Don't miss the opportunity to make this charming apartment your new home!
