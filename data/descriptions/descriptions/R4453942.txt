Elviria, the desirable area on the coastline of Marbella East that offers so much for so many, that it has become a seriously sought-after destination. This villa in Elviria ticks many of the boxes for discerning clients and for this we highly recommend that it is short-listed by any serious buyer. Located in a pretty cut-de-sac just 10 minutes walking from the commercial centres of Elviria, this villa embodies the elegance of the typical Mediterranean villa. Beautiful proportions of a property set on an elevated south-west facing plot of 1080m2, this villa is spacious and bright, with wonderful outdoor space and great privacy.
The property is accessed via automated gates onto a private driveway where there is space for 2 cars. This area is at the back of the villa and here there is the main "front door" entrance leading directly into the main home, and additionally the possibility to access the independent guest apartment from the side of the villa.
Entering the home a bright open-plan living area is the first super living space that this villa has to offer. Here, with plenty of south-west facing windows, there are views over the pool, the countryside nd to the sea beyond. A living room here benefits from an open fireplace and also accesses the upper terrace and balcony of this gorgeous Elviria villa, with the most beautiful stone staircase sweeping down to the pool area below.
