If you are a nature lover, and you are looking for peace and tranquillity, then this house is definitely for you!

Magnificent single storey country house, in the middle of hundreds of olive trees, comprising 3 bedrooms, a large bathroom with Italian shower, completely fitted open-plan kitchen with dining area, living room with fireplace, and a storeroom.

From the kitchen you can access a covered terrace, perfect for enjoying your morning coffee, and at the back of the kitchen there is a large patio where you can enjoy the afternoon shade, and a garage with utility room.

To the side of the property is lovely a green area with a large swimming pool, from where you will only hear the birds singing.

PLEASE NOTE: The access to this house is not easy. There is 11km of mountain road from Estación de Cártama to the "Ermita de las Tres Cruces", then 5km (about 15 minutes) of narrow dirt track. Once there, this house is a little paradise where you can disconnect from the hectic life of the city.
