Huge flat plot of almost 3,900 m2 situated in a private and prestigious residential area surrounded by luxury villas next to the Real Club de Golf of Sotogrande. Its building volume is 30%. 

The plot already has a project to build a villa designed by the ARK architectural studi and the relevant licenses, as well as the ICIO (the Spanish Tax on Building Works, Installations and other Constructions) already paid on the project. 

The project envisages a state-of-the-art villa on one level plus basement, with 5 en-suite bedrooms, guest toilet, office, garage for 3 cars and much more. The project description report is available on request.

The previous house has already been demolished and the plot is ready to start building.
