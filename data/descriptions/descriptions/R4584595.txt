Very well kept West facing ground floor apartment with lovely panoramic views over the country side towards Santana golf and the mountains behind from the spacious, with glass curtains installed terrace.
With shops, bars, golf, a Fitness/Paddle centre and restaurants on site and the lovely beaches of Fuengirola and La Cala just a few car-minutes away. All this in a quiet environment a lovely place for either living there permanently or second (holiday) home. The good quality furnishing is sebject to negotiation.
