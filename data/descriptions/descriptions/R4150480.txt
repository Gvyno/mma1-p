This property is currently undergoing a full renovation to the highest standard. This Scandinavian style home will be composed of three spacious bedrooms, each accompanied by their own en-suite bathrooms. This property also includes three separate terraces, all boasting beautiful sea & mountain views. 
The property comes with a full furniture package and will be key ready In January. However, if purchased before hand there are possibilities to add your own personal touches and decor to the home before completion.

This one of the most sought after locations as it is walking distance to Centro Plaza, La Sala and Puerto Banus where you'll find luxury shops, bars, restaurants & beaches. In the immediate area, there are several restaurants and a large grocery store.
