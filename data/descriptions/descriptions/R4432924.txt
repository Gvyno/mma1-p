This detached 149 m² four-bedroom, three-bathroom villa is built on 298 m² of land and is located in the heart of the much sought-after area of Nueva Andalucia.  

Very elegantly unfurnished, this property maintains some original features such as the wooden beams in the dining area. The open plan kitchen and dining area lead onto a lovely covered terrace overlooking the private garden. You will find another large terrace on the first floor where all the bedrooms are situated. 

All the rooms come equipped with air conditioning - hot & cold – and the property offers a communal swimming pool shared with one other property where you can soak up the sun and enjoy a dip in the pool. 

You have private parking large enough to fit two cars and also a basement which could be turned into a cinema room or games room or whatever you like. 

Nueva Andalucia offers an excellent location, close to Puerto Banus and its shopping and nightlife, close to several schools and golf courses. You are right in the thick of everything. As location goes, you couldn't do much better and this property at just 750,000 € would be an excellent purchase.
