Brand new Villa located in a heart of Nueva Andalucia, Marbella. 
Walking distance to Puerto Banus and all amenities, close to Aloha Golf Club & Las Brisas Golf Club, and just 1,5 km from the beach.

The residential is completely gated and private, counting with a spectacular entrance, which gives access to 6 impressive "Vilas" with state-of-the-art design. Within the entrance we can find the reception and the security guard post. 
The extensive outdoor spaces and gardens around the "Vilas", give way to a new concept of swimming pool of almost 180 m2 plus a 36 m2 children's pool, both with chlorination water treatment.

The beautifully built Villa on 4 levels offers high quality, stylish and bright living room open to the large and elegant terrace.
All 3 bedroom suites include floor-to-ceiling windows, a sleek minimalist kitchen. All 4 levels are connected by a modern elevator.

Terraces leading out to a private area of garden – as well as having access to the beautifully landscaped communal gardens and swimming pool.
Roof terrace with private swimming pool and outdoor cinema.
A customizable basement provides ample space for a home gym, an additional bedroom or room for any other use, such as an office.

Villa has a parking space for 4 cars within the communal underground parking area.

Due to its orientation and position, the entire complex enjoys natural light most of the day, and Villa is completely filled of luminosity through its incredible windows as well as through the "Central courtyard". It is also a fact that the residents will be able to enjoy the most incredible sunrises and sunsets from the spacious terraces.
