As you arrive, you'll feel instantly transported to a world far away from the hustle and bustle, surrounded by rolling hills and only one neighbor in sight.

Conveniently located just a short 11-minute drive from Aljaima train station and a mere 20 minutes from the vibrant city of Malaga, you'll have easy access to its renowned attractions, including the awe-inspiring Alcazaba castle, Picasso museum, fabulous shopping destinations, and delightful tapas bars. For beach enthusiasts, the nearest sandy shores are a scenic 40-minute drive away, as well as the Malaga International Airport.

For nature enthusiasts, the famous El Chorro gorge and Ardales lakes await in the other direction. The exhilarating Kings Walk, Spain's top tourist attraction, promises unforgettable adventures amidst stunning natural landscapes.

Spanning across 18 acres of land, this extraordinary property comprises two charming fincas, each with its own distinct character and purpose.

El Romero, the hub of the retreat center, provides a serene sanctuary for guests. Meanwhile, Finca Verde, the family house, serves as the nerve center of the retreat. El Romero is often rented out as a holiday rental home, catering to various wellness activities such as yoga, pilates, tai chi, as well as family events and special occasions.

Designed with the utmost care, Finca El Romero is nestled within an enchanting almond grove, while Finca Verde is surrounded by approximately 100 olive trees that yield exquisite organic olive oil.

The property boasts three separate escrituras (land deeds). The first escritura encompasses the retreat center, studio, and spa facilities, spanning an expansive 35,000m². The second escritura comprises 25,000m² of land, and the third escritura includes the family house, a second pool, pool bar, yoga platform, and reservoir.

Water sources are abundant, with two main wells on the land, an old traditional well, and a hunters spring set within a cave. Additionally, a 580,000-liter reservoir sits adjacent to the yoga platform. There is also the possibility to connect to town water, as some neighboring properties have done. During the summer months, an embalse water cleaning system ensures a sustainable water supply.

Both houses benefit from 3-phase electricity, which currently operates on a single bill but can be easily divided if needed. Solar panels have been installed to minimize electricity costs, generating a substantial amount of power to cover daily usage.

This stunning 150-year-old finca has been lovingly restored, preserving its authentic charm with antique tiles and original features. The eastern courtyard has been transformed into a spacious, daylight studio measuring 8m x 10m, boasting glass doors that open along one side. This versatile space serves as a hub for art retreats, functions, conferences, winter dinners, and workshops. Hot Yoga groups particularly appreciate the two super infrared heaters, which instantly heat the studio to temperatures of up to 50 degrees.

El Romero offers seven charming bedrooms, all adorned with air conditioning for maximum comfort. The ground floor features two traditional-style bedrooms, including an additional bedroom accessed from the outside seating area. The large and inviting lounge, characterized by wooden beams, houses a glass-fronted wood burner and provides access to the generously sized kitchen, capable of catering to groups of over 25 people. Charming original bathrooms can be found within the house, with an additional bathroom situated across the courtyard.

The pool area features additional amenities, including a mosaic-tiled Haman-style steam room measuring 3m x 3m, seating 16 people, and a cave sauna complete with speakers. A large decked area with an adjacent shower serves as a tranquil space, often utilized for small yoga classes. Shade sails and 3m-high poles provide relief during the warmer months, while a 3m x 4m screen can be projected for swim-in cinema experiences. Adjacent to the pool, a 6m x 3.5m bathroom block offers tastefully designed units comprising a full bathroom, a shower room, and a separate toilet room. The pool, measuring 8m x 5m, comes with a cover, roller, and shower. A pipe system is available for heating the pool during the early and late months of the year.

Two delightful wooden-covered areas add to the charm, one featuring railway sleeper-designed seats, while the other offers a cozy bed nestled beneath a grapevine, perfect for indulging in siestas. As you wander further along the pool area, you'll find a path leading to the remarkable Yoga platform.
