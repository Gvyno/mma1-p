Excellent investment opportunity for a leasehold! We are presenting a fully equipped restaurant located near Puerto Banus in the Marbella area, with stunning views of the sea and the surrounding landscape. This establishment features a spacious kitchen, with seating available both indoors and on the outside terrace.

The kitchen is a true paradise for chefs, equipped with spacious work areas and high-quality equipment. The smart design ensures that delightful aromas of the cuisine remain in the kitchen, thanks to strategically positioned air ducts. Additionally, the interior environment is serene, with acoustically treated ceilings that minimize noise and create an intimate atmosphere for potential customers.

Behind the scenes, the kitchen is divided into hot, cold, and wet areas, with ample storage space that meets all safety standards. Ventilation and air ducts are meticulously maintained, and we have comprehensive fire safety equipment.

The furniture includes high-quality wooden tables. We are proud to be the only restaurant in the area with two bathrooms, one of which is adapted for people with disabilities. Our crockery and cutlery come from a renowned Portuguese brand known for its exceptional quality and craftsmanship.

Natural light floods the space through the glass walls that can be opened during the summer, allowing guests to enjoy the stunning surroundings. In winter, the restaurant can be closed with noise-reducing curtains and internal heaters to keep customers cozy.

The restaurant&#039;s terrace offers a breathtaking view of the sea and, on the other side, an incredible view of La Concha mountain, the most famous in Marbella. This spectacular landscape provides an impressive setting for customers to enjoy their meals. The panoramic view is a distinctive feature of this establishment, making it an ideal destination for those seeking an unforgettable culinary experience.

This is a unique opportunity to acquire an established and well-equipped restaurant in a privileged location. We look forward to presenting you with this investment opportunity.
