This very large corner townhouse has been totally refurbished recently to modern and quality standards. It offers 4 spacious bedrooms, one of the ground floor and the other 3 on the first floor; 2 bathrooms, one being en-suite with the master bedroom and a guest toilet downstairs. The ground floor is a spacious open living space from the entrance to the sunny south facing terrace and garden, with a large and modern fully equipped kitchen. The property is situated in the urbanisation of Miraflores which is a very popular beachside area surrounded by golf courses, restaurants, bars and shops. Ideal for holidays but it could also be a cosy family home.
