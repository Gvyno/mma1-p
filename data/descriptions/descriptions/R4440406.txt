SEASIDE SERENITY BECKONS:  PREMIER HOME RIGHT ON THE BEACH.  START YOUR BEACH LIFE TODAY!!
A truly unique location by the sea property where you can hear the sea lapping on the shore and see the lights over in Morocco as you go to sleep at night, where your view of the sea with the sun glistening on the water when you wake in the morning is a truly unimpeded view, not a view over other roof tops but a feeling of connection to the sea

I think that would be more appealing to anyone wanting a house by the sea for personal vacations or a permanent home.
