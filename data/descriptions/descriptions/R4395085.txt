This is a fabulous apartment for sale located in one of the most sought after urbanisations on the coast, Hacienda del Sol.

The complex has many facilities such as multiple pools, gym, games room, padel tennis and much more. It is just a 5 minute walk to the beach and a couple of minutes from the Marriott Resort. Also just 5 minutes away is a commercial centre with cafes and a supermarket. 

This 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom apartment would make an ideal holiday home, investment for holiday rentals, or even a more permanent home. For a property like this you could expect between €1,200 and €1,400 per week in peak season for holiday rentals. It has a more than adequate sized lounge/diner with working fireplace which leads out on to a spacious terrace that looks over the pool.

There is a utility room off of the fully fitted kitchen and very spacious kitchen which is bright ans has multiple windows.

Both bedrooms are a good size and can accommodate double beds in each.

This has literally just been listed (August 2023) and we expect there to be a lot of interest in this property so early viewings are advisable.
