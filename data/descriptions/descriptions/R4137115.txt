INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY! This estate is classified as a 'finca rustica' and with the recent (2021) change in the law in Andalucia governing these types of properties you are now allowed to demolish the house and build a completely new one, as long as the built surface is maintained. This means that this estate is now a huge investment opportunity for either an investor wanting to do so and resell it, or for the discerning owner wanting to create a dream property within one of the best addresses you can get in Spain! And that in an urbanisation where villas have recently sold with prices up to 12 million euros!

Villa Los Picos is located within the gated Los Picos estate, next to Sierra Blanca, Marbella's answer to Beverly Hills.
