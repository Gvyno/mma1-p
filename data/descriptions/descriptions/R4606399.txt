Now comes the opportunity you've longed for, DO NOT LEAVE IT!!!!

EXCLUSIVE PROPERTY!!!

Property located in the centre of Malaga, in a building with tradition and with a perfect orientation to enjoy the sun of our beautiful capital of Malaga.

This property that we are talking about, is located in a semi-static floor and is distributed as follows:
Entrance hall leading on the right hand side to a spacious lounge with access to a sunny terrace with unobstructed views, and opposite is the master bedroom with en-suite bathroom (shower) and access to the same terrace as the lounge.
Then we will pass to a corridor that will distribute the rest of the house. 
On the left side of the corridor we have a complete bathroom and a laundry room, and on the right hand side we will find a kitchen with pantry, a double bedroom, another double bedroom and a room that could be triple, and that gives access to a very large terrace with wonderful open views where you can enjoy the sunsets of Malaga in the centre of the city. 
On the terrace we will also find a good storage room that is perfect to store everything that you have left over in the house.

It should be noted that the property is built with very good qualities, there are only two neighbours per floor, there are multiple fitted wardrobes and everything is exterior, which makes the luminosity another of the main factors that push you to acquire this property.

The building also has a concierge and good access for people with disabilities.

Let's not forget another of the super important extras to take into account when you live in the centre of a city, its ample parking space.

COMPLETE AVAILABILITY FOR VISITS.


Possibility of redistributing the property to convert it back into a five bedroom.

HOLIDAY RENTALS ARE NOT ALLOWED.
IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS, THE METRO WILL STOP 100M FROM THE PROPERTY.
