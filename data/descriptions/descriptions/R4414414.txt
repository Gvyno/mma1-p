INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY
Immaculate Independent Villa for Sale
Location: Benalmádena, Costa del Sol
Price: 699 000 €

This beautifully kept, classic Andalucían villa is built over 256m2, on a large plot of 1.042m2. The property is well situated in a quiet cul de sac, close to the thriving port of Benalmádena on the Costa del Sol in Spain. It is also just 20 minutes' walk to Benalmádena marina, a 3-minute drive to major supermarkets and amenities, 30 mins to Marbella and Málaga City Centre, and 15 mins from Málaga Airport. 

Outside of making a lovely family home, the size of this plot offers investors the opportunity to consider more building projects or the extension and refurbishment of the current house. There is a huge potential for someone to transform this beautiful property further. The gardens surrounding this villa are immaculately cared for and well established. It would also make a fantastic holiday rental.

The house is mostly built on one level, apart from the main bedroom which is entered via a few steps leading into a very large bedroom with its own lounge area, built in wardrobes and ensuite bathroom. 

There is a huge lounge and dining room with stone gas fireplace, a sizeable fully fitted kitchen is found off the lounge with gas hob and electric oven. Also at this level, there are two more bedrooms with built in wardrobes, sharing a large bathroom. There is internal access to the garage where the current owner has set up a workshop, but the garage can fit one car plus ample storage. There is room to park a second car outside the garage door, and there is street parking available right outside the property. 

From the kitchen there is direct access to a covered outdoor dining and BBQ area, jacuzzi, sun deck and a few steps down to the private pool, all hidden behind a high, secure perimeter fence.

The whole house has been fitted with gas central heating, gas hot water supply and air conditioning.
