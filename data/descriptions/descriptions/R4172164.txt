Very unique building in the center of Málaga city. This buidling, built in the year 1900, is one of the few existing houses called "Corralon". In Andalusia it is a popular term to designate interior spaces in multi-family dwellings with a cantilevered gallery around a patio or central plaza and originally with a well or a fountain. Some examples of this type are conserved in the neighborhoods of Málaga city. These buildings have led the public administration to organize beautification contests to encourage the integration of the inhabitants of these buildings and to maintain the history and tradition. This building already offers two seperate apartments, a large patio, garages, parking spaces and terraces. Besides its unique features, it could either be a private home, could be turned into used a bed & breakfast business or to be built brand new apartments, taking advantage of the patio and mixed with andalucian history!
