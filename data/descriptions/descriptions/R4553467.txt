Los Almendros de Los Arqueros is the only community within Los Arqueros Golf & Country Club made up exclusively of townhouses. Constructed in 2 phases, there are just 33 properties in total.

The spacious townhouses have either three or four bedrooms, private terrace or garden (or both) and private garages. Built to the highest quality to be expected from Taylor Woodrow, these properties are much sought-after. Each features cream marble flooring, hot and cold A/C, designer fitted kitchens with Bosch appliances and open fireplaces in the lounge. 

Los Almendros boasts two communal swimming pools offering stunning views over the beautiful 18-hole Los Arqueros Golf course and the Mediterranean Sea. The community maintains manicured landscaped communal gardens and the additional security of being a gated development.
