A lovely large family villa situated on a generous plot of over 1000m2 in La Sierrezuela, Mijas Costa.

The property is bright and fresh throughout with lots of natural light featuring large rooms with high ceilings and has been very well maintained by the current owners. It is offered key-ready to move in. 

Entry to the property is via electric gates leading to a private garage with space for more cars on the drive. The house consists, on the entrance level of a lovely wide entrance hall, split level lounge diner with feature fireplace,  and a brand new renovated fully fitted kitchen with central island and separate utility room. On this floor we also have a guest cloakroom and two double bedrooms both with fitted wardrobes and ensuite bathrooms. The lounge enjoys access outside to a lovely covered terrace with lots of room for outdoor furniture as well as outdoor dining table and chairs which in turn leads to the lawned garden with fruit trees complete with 50m2 private swimming pool.

Moving upstairs we find a home office at the top of the staircase with access to a large open terrace with glorious views over the pool and garden to the mountains and surrounding countryside. Also on this level are two further double bedrooms also with fitted wardrobes, a single bedroom which was previously a bathroom and could easily be converted back, and another family bathroom.

Additionally in the basement of the property is another space with natural light currently being used as storage but could easily become a gym, cinema room or even a 6th bedroom is needed.

The villa is located in a quiet road yet only 15 minutes walking distance to shops and amenities including supermarket, bars and restaurants.
