Magnificent little semi-detached house in the highly sought-after El Paraiso district between 2 golf courses
2 km from the beach, 8 minutes from Puerto Banus and 8 minutes from Estepona
in a small condominium of 14 houses.
The house has 2 floors.
on the ground floor, the kitchen, dining room and living room with a separate toilet, a small covered terrace and a garden overlooking the communal gardens and the swimming pool.
on the first floor there are two bedrooms, one of which is en suite.
Lots of charm...
