Modern and recent built villa located just 3 minutes walk from the center of El Rosario and 15 minutes walk down to the beach. The villa sits on a large plot with plenty of parking spaces, a swimming pool and a lower level suitable for vegetable garden, putting green, sport or whatever you fancy!
The house is built on 2 levels with living room and an open plan fitchen upstairs together with master bedroom, 2 smaller guest bedrooms and a bathroom. Downstairs is a huge multi-purpose room, storage area and a large bedroom and bathroom. Direct access to the swimming pool area from the downstairs multipurpose room, and also with some steps down from the terrace outside the living room. 
Excellent holiday house with great rental potential. It also has scope for further development.
