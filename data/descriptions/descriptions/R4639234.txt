A few minutes from Marbella, between mountains and nature, we find this villa in one of the most outstanding private urbanizations in Malaga.
Entering through the house we find a hallway that takes us to the two floors of the house. Upstairs, we find a hall that presents 3 rooms. On the left, the master room, with en-suite bathroom and two large fitted wardrobes and exit to the terrace, where we can enjoy spectacular panoramic views, observing the dam of La Concepcion, the sea, the Sierra de las Nieves, UNESCO's natural reserve, as well as the beautiful La Concha. The second, also with access to the terrace and fitted wardrobes. A shared toilet and a large studio that can be converted if you want it in another room. It should be noted that all the bathrooms in this house have a shower and bathtub.
On the ground floor, we find a living room with four exits to a covered terrace overlooking the garden and the pool. On the left of the living room we have a fully equipped kitchen that takes us to two separate rooms, the warehouse and the laundry. On the right of the living room we find a guest toilet and a large bathroom. Also, a guest room with access to a covered terrace.
The house, being built in the center of the plot, gives us paved roads full of vegetation, palm trees, lemon trees and plants around it, to reach the garden with swimming pool, from where we will enjoy spectacular views.
