Fantastic very bright semi-detached house of 208 m2 with wonderful views of the Torrequebrada golf course! SUN SUN SUN!
A very good community where you will find tranquility and very beautiful views of the golf course, the lake and the pool and a lot of greenery and it is close to schools, shops and the beach.
The Torrequebrada Golf clubhouse is just 100 meters away.
The property's parking is private, outdoors.
The property is spread over 3 floors connected to each other and one more floor with a bedroom and a bathroom completely independent and in front of the pool.
On the ground floor we find a toilet, a modern kitchen with an island and windows that give lots of light and views of the gardens. The kitchen is open to a very spacious living room, with large windows and from where you can access a very good terrace where you can eat while looking at the golf and the lake.
Climbing the staircase with a glass railing, we access the first floor where we find two rooms with a shared bathroom and the master bedroom with an en-suite bathroom and a charming terrace with the same views of the golf.
On the second floor we have a large central room with windows on both sides that open completely so you can enjoy the outdoors with friends.
