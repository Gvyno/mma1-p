Located on a dead end street, with very little noise and open views. 3-story townhouse including the garage. The garage has been converted into an independent apartment, with access to the porch of the house. Then as we go up we have a covered terrace, guest toilet, living room and kitchen. In the back we have a large patio for barbecues. On the next floor we have two bedrooms, one of them with access to another large open terrace. And one more floor we have another bedroom and a large community bathroom. The orientation of the house is south, so it has great light. A few meters further down we have a sports club that has a swimming pool, paddle tennis courts and a cafeteria. Access is free to neighbors (paid within the community).
