Cozy, warm, harmonious, modern and very beautiful. It is how this property deserves to be described.
An apartment in the heart of Fuengirola, just a few steps from the beach, the train and bus stations, the center of Fuengirola and the trendy bars. With 2 bedrooms, 2 complete bathrooms with shower, open kitchen, living room and terrace. It has few m2... yes, but they are perfectly used.
The house has been completely renovated, from "0", with all the new walls, installations and floors. It is sold as it appears in the photos, with all the furniture and decoration.
Where is the error? It is a third floor without elevator. But if you are fit, do not hesitate to contact us to organize a visit.
