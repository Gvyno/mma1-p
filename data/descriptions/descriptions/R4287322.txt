Large house in the attractive village of El Chorro with many possibilities for rental but needs some modernization !!

Village house to be refurbished but then a house with a very good rental potential.
Currently the house offers a living room, completely newly installed kitchen, 3 bedrooms and 1 bathroom.
Next to this building there is another (to be modernized) guest studio with an en-suite bathroom and a shed.

Across the entire house there is a large roof terrace with views over El Chorro and its beautiful rock formations.
At the front there is a large terrace for breakfast or dinner and then there is ample space for placing a swimming pool and a sun terrace.

El Chorro is a tourist attraction because of the "Caminito del Rey" and the many climbing walls.
This house could be a nice B & B or holiday rental after the necessary modernization.
