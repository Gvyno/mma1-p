Mijas Pueblo or known locally as the white village sits in the foothills of the Mijas Mountains some 428m above sea level. The village provides some of the most stunning and breath-taking views of the surrounding areas down to the coast, inland and the rugged rocky landscape.
The village is not only very popular with tourists visiting for the day or vacationing in the village but with local residents from nearby towns and villages. The attraction of Mijas Pueblo is the authenticity the village provides of the Spanish way of life from the cobbled streets, white washed walls and array of artisan shops and boutiques to the many traditional festivals celebrated from the main plaza (square) sat centrally in the village.
