ATALAYA PENTHOUSE 

A must-see, penthouse in one of the best communities Alhaurin Golf has to offer.  The property offers two bedrooms, two bathrooms, two terraces, a spacious kitchen and large living and dining room.  

The Atalaya urbanization is gated, well maintained, provides a sense of space, great views of the golf course and beyond, and offers a feeling of being more colonial than the typical Spanish apartment complex. 

This penthouse is in arguably the best building Atalaya has to offer.  Looking attractive and feels both personal and secure.  The apartment is very private with no overlooking buildings.  There is secure parking and lift access to the apartment. Compared to many apartment complexes, this building offers a premium and high-end feel. 

The apartment itself feels larger than its size, is light, airy and provides a myriad of fantastic mountains, national park, and golf views.  Both bedrooms are of a good size as are the kitchen and lounge.  The large and usable upper terrace view is staggering in scale and movement, unique to this penthouse.  The off-lounge terrace is extremely practical, good sized and very usable, again with a fabulous, different view.   

The apartment is well cared for and presents well.  The opportunity to update or leave as is will appeal to a wide range of buyers looking for an investment, short- or long-term rental income, as a lock-up and leave holiday home or for permanent living.    

Alhaurin Golf is well placed for Mijas, La Cala, Fuengirola, Malaga Airport, Marbella and beyond. There are several beaches and golf courses within a 20-minute drive and an extensive number of restaurants in the local vicinity.  Alhaurin Golf itself was designed by Severiano Ballesteros and is deemed a true test of a golf.   

We recommend a visit to the property to take in the views, space and privacy afforded by this one of one penthouse.    The property is sold fully furnished.
