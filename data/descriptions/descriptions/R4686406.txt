FANTASTIC 3 BEDROOM APARTMENT WITH SEA VIEWS! Located BETWEEN ESTEPONA AND SAN PEDRO DE ALCANTARA, BOTH ONLY 10 MIN BY CAR, this urbanization is ONLY 12 MIN WALKING TO THE BEACH, so you will be just a few minutes to enjoy the coastal path and stroll along the shores of the Mediterranean. Close to supermarkets, schools and health center. The apartment has a large living room very bright that communicates with the spacious independent kitchen, fully equipped. The property has three bedrooms and a large bathroom, two single bedrooms and a double bedroom that has access to the covered terrace with sea and mountain views, the same views you can enjoy from the living room. The urbanization is well maintained and enjoys swimming pool, gardens, children's playground, soccer and basketball courts. Currently gives a good return as a holiday rental but is a great property for a family. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
