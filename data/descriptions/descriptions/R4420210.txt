Centrally located at the start of Calle Malaga and next to Plaza de la Paz, this property has been recently renovated and has great potential to be used as a home, a boutique hotel, to open a business like a restaurant on the lower level and use the top level as an home, or even to build another level and extend the living space. 

It has an open courtyard covered with a 100-year-old viñard, could be a fantastic space for a restaurant terrace. It also has a large sunny roof terrace with mountain views and overlooking Mijas village. 

A historic home full of charm with endless possibilities.
