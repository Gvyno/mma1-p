This large authentic townhouse is located on a very central position, in the whitewashed village of Guaro. The house is in need of a complete reform and has a lot of potential. Sitting on the corner, the property is spread over 2 floors and offers a collection of rooms that all have plenty of natural light coming in. There are 5 bedrooms, a typical Spanish patio that runs through the center of the property and even some outbuildings once used for housing animals. These could be converted into accommodation. There is a lot of space, ready to be made the most of. The property could be the ideal place to start a Bed & Breakfast business. If you like the charm of being in a typical Andalusian village, surrounded by beautiful nature and yet only 30 minutes away from the coast of Marbella, this could be the property for you.
