This charming unfurnished finca of 135m2, built in 2004 and located just 10 minutes from the center of Coin, offers fantastic panoramic views.

Via a very nice fully glazed terrace, you enter a spacious living room with a fireplace as well as a beautiful American kitchen. The finca has 3 bedrooms, the 3rd bedroom is currently being used as a dining room but can easily be converted back into a bedroom. One of the bedrooms has air conditioning and a bathroom en suite with a shower, the other bathroom has a bathtub with a Jacuzzi function.

The 6.232 m2 plot with almond trees is completely fenced and was created with great attention to detail and well maintained, there is also a large garage for one car and 3 separate storage sheds. By the pool there is a wonderful BBQ area and a very nice wooden veranda from which you can enjoy the views of the mountains.

The water supply is provided by a well and 2 reserve tanks, each with a capacity of 10,000l, the hot water supply comes from solar panels that still have a 12-year guarantee.

The property is close to the main road (which leads to Guaro, Monda and Alozaina) and has a tarmac access road.
