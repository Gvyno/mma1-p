What a beautiful apartment in Mijas Golf!
It's on the second floor, has three bedrooms and two bathrooms, so there's plenty of space for everyone! If you like golf, you're in luck, because you only need a three-minute drive to get to the golf club! And if you feel like going to the beach, don't worry! In just thirteen minutes, you will be enjoying the sun and sand in the center of Fuengirola.
The apartment is super cozy, south west facing, and the views of the golf course are stunning! The bedrooms have built-in wardrobes and access to the rear terrace. And the kitchen is wonderful, with a partially American design and fully equipped. Furthermore, next to the kitchen is the dining room and living room, with direct access to the main terrace! Ideal to enjoy a family dinner with spectacular views!
And what about the community pool? It's great! Fully accessible for people with disabilities. The apartment also features marble floors, double glazed windows, underfloor heating in the main bathroom, centralized hot and cold A/C, a parking space in the underground communal garage and a storage room. And best of all, it is sold furnished!
It is located within a very well maintained gated community, so it is an excellent investment opportunity for a second home or family home!
