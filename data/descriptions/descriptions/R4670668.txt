Fantastic location for this 2 bedroom apartment situated in Calahonda Park at a short walking distance of the Calahonda Beach and all the necessary amenities at hand. The apartment is a second floor with elevator and it has lovely open views onto the large gardens of the Urbanization and sea views. The apartment needs some TLC and the 2 bathrooms and the kitchen would benefit of some renovation . The living-dining and the main bedroom leads to the east facing terrace. This is a fantasctic opportunity to buy an apartment in this sought after Urbanization to renovate and make it at your own taste to spend wonderful holidays next to the beach or as a rental investment. The Urbanization offers 2 swimming-pools, very well maintained gardens and a communal gated parking area for the residents. A bus stop is at the door of the urbanization to take you to Marbella or Fuengirola or you can drive there in only 10mn.
