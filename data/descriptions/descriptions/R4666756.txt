The Internal patio is really the heart of this characterful property , a large enclosed walled area, which connects the two parts of the house together. Partly covered , but mostly open to the sky , letting in sunshine throughout the year . There is a wood door that opens directly onto the street – which is very useful for deliveries . In the patio there is a built in wood store , and the original stone wash basin . Ample space for sunbeds and garden furniture . space for a hot tub even !
