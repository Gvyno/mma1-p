King`s Hills introduces a distinctive project featuring 9 standalone villas, each set apart by its generous size, distinctive appearance, unique style, and thoughtful layout.

These villas embrace avant-garde architectural design and meticulously planned interior spaces, adhering to the highest construction standards, all harmoniously integrated into their natural surroundings.

With a south-southwest orientation, these villas span three floors, offering spacious, light-filled rooms that provide a living space ranging from 383 to 522 square meters, ensuring maximum comfort within a tranquil environment ideal for experiencing true home living.

The open-plan design of the ground floor seamlessly connects living and dining areas with a well-appointed kitchen, creating distinct yet interconnected spaces for cooking, dining, and relaxation.

The upper floor extends the luxury with additional bedrooms, each featuring a private bathroom and direct access to a terrace.
All bedrooms feature hardwood flooring, adding an element of both elegance and comfort.

For added convenience, homeowners can opt for a Jacuzzi and a dumbwaiter to transport food, beverages, and more directly from the kitchen to the dining and barbecue area on the terrace.

The multi-purpose basement offers complete customization options, enabling the creation of an extra bedroom, a fitness area, a game room, or a study.
Additionally, the villa includes two parking spaces and a spacious storage room with versatile use.
