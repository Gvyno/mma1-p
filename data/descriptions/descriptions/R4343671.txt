Three bedroom bungalow with additional one bedroom guest apartment set in a beautiful south facing plot. 

This property is located very close to a whole range of amenities (including tennis, golf, bowls, shops, cafes, restaurants etc) but feels very calm and relaxing thanks to its large private garden with mature trees and pool.

As you enter the property, there is ample parking on the driveway or a garage if you prefer. The villa is all on one level and as soon as you enter you can see the stunning gardens through the glass patio doors to the rear. The kitchen is located close to the front door, adjacent to a laundry room (with additional access to the outside of the house) and guest cloakroom. The kitchen is very large and offers plenty of space for a family to gather and eat together. 

The living and dining room have patio doors leading out to a covered terrace festooned with bougainvillea and other plants typical to the area. There is an area for relaxing, a dining area, a barbecue area and much more. From the garden you can also access the bar which has its own guest toilet and shower and, at the other end of the garden, a guest annexe with bedroom, bathroom and walk in wardrobe. This annexe can also be accessed from the driveway for more independent visitors. 

The main bungalow has three good sized bedrooms. The master bedroom has an ensuite bathroom while the other two guest bedrooms share a family bathroom. 

This charming villa would make a perfect family home, rental investment property or holiday home.
