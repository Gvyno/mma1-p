Motivated seller. Huge price drop!

This stunning apartment has the bet of both worls: it is located in the very historic centre of Malaga in a beautiful, representative building which was a roper city palace 100 years ago, and yet it is totally new becausse the building was entirely gutted. And so while we can enjoy the amazing central setting and features characteristic of city palaces, it is fitted with fibre optic and all modern technology as well as an underground parking (!) at he same time.

The ceiling are very high and so there is a lot of light coming through the tall windows adorned by classical mediterranean shutters and pretty little Juliette balconies.

The interior design has been profesionally done and utilizes perfectly the space as well as reflecing modern trends.

It is walkng distance to hundreds of bars, restaurants, shops. Literally all of the beautiful old town of Malaga is at the door step.

It is 6 minutes walking to the Cathedral, 12 minutes to the new metro station Atarazanas, and 18 minutes to the beach of Malagueta.

For city lovers itś a dream come true!
