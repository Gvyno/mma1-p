Two bedroom, one bathroom ground floor apartment in complex with two lovely outdoor pools, jacuzzi, concierge reception area, gym, bar, community wifi and security. It is currently undergoing a lot of improvements to make it an even more desirable location that it already is!

Located just above the El Paraiso Golf course (with access to the course available to members from just below the complex), the apartment is currently rented very successfully to families and golfing holidaymakers on a week by week basis. Whereas some properties in this complex are limited in terms of how many days they can be occupied by the owners, this property is not included in that scheme and owners are free to choose if they rent it out or not, and for how long.

The apartment is fully equipped with kitchen area, living and dining room with sofa bed, two double bedrooms, family bathroom and separate laundry room. 

Supermarkets, shops and restaurants and within a five minute drive, with the best beaches accessible within an easy ten minute drive. There are two tennis clubs nearby as well as a popular bowling club. Benahavis, the gastronomic capital of the Costa del Sol and a pretty white village is located within ten minutes drive. It's also home to several other golf courses and popular nature walks.

Great investment if you're looking to rent out to holiday makers.
