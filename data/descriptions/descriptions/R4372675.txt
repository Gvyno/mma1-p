3 Bedroom Penthouse with 134m2 terrace in the Hipódromo area near Fuengirola.
5 minutes by car from the Miramar shopping center and 7 from the beach, surrounded by green areas and in the area of the chaparral forest, this wonderful home is located in a privileged enclave with almost 360º views from where we have beautiful panoramic views from the sea and the mountains with great privacy since the house is on the corner.
The interior is divided into a living-dining room with access to the huge terrace in which a kind of storage room has been made. Independent equipped kitchen although it would be easy to pull the partition and include it in the living room. Master bedroom with ensuite bathroom which in turn leads to another extra bedroom that the current owners have removed from the terrace (so there would now be 4 bedrooms) and 2 bedrooms plus a full bathroom in the hallway.
The urbanization is very well maintained and is within a closed area with many well-kept green areas and a swimming pool open all year.
A house with a lot of potential and with enormous views and outdoor area that also has an underground garage and storage room.
