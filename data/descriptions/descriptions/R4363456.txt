Great investment!
This plot, sold with plans and drawings of a beautiful contemporary villa, designed by a well-known London architect and developer and approved by the council, is a unique opportunity for any investor. It has 6 spacious bedrooms, 5 bathrooms, an elevator, a cinema, a gym, a garage for 3 cars, a garden and a swimming pool with views over the Costa del Sol. The plot with plan for the villa is located in a sought after gated community just 15 minutes drive from the airport, 10 minutes from the coast, Mijas Pueblo and Fuengirola and 15 minutes walking distance from two restaurants and a well known, beautiful tennis and padel club. The elderly architect/developer has arranged and paid for all the paperwork and permits and is waiting for a future resident, investor or developer to take over. There is currently nothing comparable on the market, but research shows that this villa at this location can generate around 2 million euros after construction. Short term/holiday rental yields approximately 3k per week in low season and 5k per week in high season. This plot is located next to another, somewhat smaller plot, which also has approved drawings and technical calculations of a state-of-the-art villa. In addition, there is a commercial plot without planning permission where a nursing home, boutique hotel or a spa would fit well, given the demand for these types of facilities. After all, the plots are located on a hill with a magnificent view, in the middle of nature, but in a gated community for maximum security. Ask for more information about the lots together.
