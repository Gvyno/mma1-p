ABSOLUTE BARGAIN!!!

This property is an absolute bargain. The complete shell of a 4 story house spanning 430m2 on a 120m2 plot located at the top part of Tolox.

The ground floor has been used by the family and has a makeshift kitchen and bathroom with double garage doors. This could be the garage/storage area or living space and has both electricity and water.

The remaining floors; 1st, 2nd and the top floor are a blank canvas to either make a large family home, independent apartments or a Rural Tourism project.

Tolox has a population of 2.3 thousand and is situated in the centre of the Sierra de las Nieves Nature Park, making this little town a very interesting place for hikers, mountain bikes and birdwatching. Apart from this Tolox offers its famous natural spa "Fuente Amargosa" which is visited for respiratory and allergic afflictions.

The whitewashed town has many shops, supermarkets, bars, restaurants, municipal sports centre and municipal gym.

Malaga airport is only 1 hour by car away, 50 minutes to Marbella and 25 minutes to Coin where there are many large supermarkets.
