BEACHFRONT LOCATION !!!! This beautiful beachfront townhouse has 3 bedrooms and 2.5 bathrooms. It is spacious and bright with amazing natural light throughout the house. The kitchen is large and has been extended. There are 2 large, south facing terraces. One is off the sitting room/dining room with direct access to the communal gardens and pool which is shared by only 22 houses. From these gardens you have private access to the beautiful sandy beach in front. There is nothing but garden between the house and the beach so the views are spectacular. Coming from the beach there is gated access only to this development to ensure privacy and the gardens are gated to ensure children´s safety. The distribution of the house is as follows: Downstairs: Entrance hall, kitchen, guest loo, sitting room/dining room with fireplace, large private patio with BBQ with direct access to the communal gardens and pool. First floor: 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms, one en suite. Second floor: an amazing roof terrace with beautiful open sea and beach views with mature tropical gardens below.

This house is big enough to be used as a permanent residence as well as a fantastic lock up and leave holiday home. It would also be an excellent investment as this property would rent easily throughout the year due to its fabulous location.
Conveniently located next to the urbanisation is the Casares Sports Club which residents can use for a small fee. A myriad of shops, bars and restaurants are also within easy walking distance, and several renowned golf courses are within easy reach.
