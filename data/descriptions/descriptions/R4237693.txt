A cozy villa in one of the best urbanizations of Costa del Sol, Torrequebrada in Benalmadena Costa. Close to the famous golf course Torrequebrada Golf. Walking distance to the beach, supermarket, restaurants, bars, pharmacy, health care center, school, etc. Very close to the Torrequebrada International College, which has just been chosen as the second best school in the whole Malaga province.

Open views to the mountains, to the sea and to the golf course. Beautiful garden with many fruit trees and flowers. Nice pool area and several terraces, open and covered, where to enjoy the Andalusian sun the whole day. From this villa you have also an amazing view of the sunset when the sun goes down behind the mountains.

The house has 3 bedrooms but it is possible to make one more by modifying the kitchen. It is also quite easy to open the kitchen to the living-dining room and like this the kitchen-living-dining room would be very spacious and full of light.

Then this might be your dream house! Don´t hesitate to ask for a viewing, the villa is much better in real life than in the photos. Contact us and we will show you this very nice villa.
