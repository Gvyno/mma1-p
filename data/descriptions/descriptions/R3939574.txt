Casarabonela is located at the foothills of Sierra Prieta, part of the Sierra de las Nieves. The air is clean and the views are stunning, due to the elevated position of the village. It is an ideal base for outdoor- and nature lovers. Hiking, biking, horse riding or just a walk through the mountains and forest, with views over the Guadalhorce valley and even the ocean, are the perfect way to relax and enjoy the peace and quietness of the beautiful surroundings. 


Walking through the narrow whitewashed streets, you will discover the Moorish soul, combined with Christian elements and Roman remains. The village has a central church and many plazas and outside terraces where you can enjoy sunshine, local tapas and a drink. Also at night you can join the locals for a drink in one of the bars. 


At the highest part of town, the remains of the Arab Castle Casarabonela are visible, besides its historical value it is an exceptional viewpoint! Casarabonela is located only 40 minutes (47 km.) from Málaga and the airport. The beaches of the Costa del Sol are a 45 minutes (62 km.) drive.
