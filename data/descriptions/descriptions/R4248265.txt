Penthouse for sale in one of the best communicated areas in Los Pacos-Fuengirola. This property is located a few meters from the Galp petrol station and one minute from the motorway. This urbanization has 6 blocks, spacious communal areas, paddle tennis court, gardens and swimming pools.  We arrive at the penthouse on the fourth floor where we have a large entrance hall that communicates us to the different divisions of the property and also to the staircase where the large terrace is located.
On the first floor there are 3 bedrooms, one of them with en suite bathroom with bathtub. We also have a second complete bathroom with shower. The independent kitchen, due to its spaciousness, allows us to comfortably prepare breakfast or quick meals... The living room has enough space to take advantage of the sofa and TV area, as well as the dining room for 8 people if you want. Finally, next to this beautiful living room there is a terrace with a glass enclosure, very luminous and where we have a clear view.
At the top of the stairs we will find the large terrace of 58 m2 where works were carried out for the enjoyment and greater comfort. It has a meeting room equipped with TV, fridge, butane barbecue, storage space, glass enclosure, metal roof and false wooden ceiling. This area is connected to the rest of the terrace with a garden set (for 8 people), comfortable outdoor armchairs where you can enjoy the sun, charcoal barbecue area, electric oven, sink and a small bar. This great opportunity gives us that privacy so difficult to find, wonderful views to the mountains, to live 10 minutes from the beaches without being in the middle of the city centre, very fast communication with the motorway, schools nearby and all the necessary services of the day to day.
