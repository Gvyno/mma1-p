Fantastic newly modernised apartment in the heart of central Fuengirola!

Best location right in the center, close to restaurants, shops and with only 200 meters to the beach.
Southwest orientation terrace with sun all throughout the day till the sunset goes down behind city.
This apartment was modernised in 2018. 

Great investment opportunity. It has LPO and ready for a turist license if you want to rent it out. AC in every room. 

Parking is avalible in the nearby public underground parking with around 70-99€ for a month if you need a parking spot.
