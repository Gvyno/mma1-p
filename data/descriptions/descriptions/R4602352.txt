Fantastic house in the centre of Fuengirola, 200 metres from the beach and close to all amenities and services. The property is completely refurbished. It has 3 spacious bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, independent kitchen, patio, large living room with fireplace, and a fantastic terrace of 94 meters to enjoy the sun all day. It does not pay community fees. It is ideal to live with the family. Although it is currently as a house, it is a plot located in a privileged area to build a building.
