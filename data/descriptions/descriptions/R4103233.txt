One of the nicest houses Ive listed this year in HIPODROMO RESIDENCIAL. The property is a short drive to the beach, town and is set in a high end, closed community with fantastic facilities. The urbanisation boasts Basketball court, Padel Tennis court, green areas, water features, sauna, Large swimming pool, children's pool covered play areas, mature gardens and its enclosure makes it an ideal environment for kids. 
The house Itself is equally impressive with plenty of outside space including a jacuzzi and several terraces. 
The property has recently undergone a tasteful revamp. All the rooms a spacious and flooded with natural light. Really is worth a visit, ideal for Family, investment or holiday home.
