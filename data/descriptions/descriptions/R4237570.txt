Villa Mariposa, the perfect mix between Scandinavian and Andalusian style. It is one of the most beautiful and practical houses in La Capellanía, with the main house all in one level and with breathtaking sea views from almost everywhere on the plot and in the house. 
This Villa has been renovated recently in the highest qualities with underfloor heating, Italian marble floors, designer kitchen and bathroom furniture. Big open spaces at the terrace are directly in level with the house. 
The main house has 3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms and a big kitchen facing the front terrace, all in one level and connected to the pool area. Under the terrace there is an annex bedroom of aprox 25m2 with its own small chill out terrace, and en suite bathroom. 

The plot is big enough to extend the house or even build a second floor, so the possibilities are not yet all covered ;) 

Do not hesitate in contacting us for viewings or more information!!

La Capellanía belongs to Benalmádena, the ideal place to live quietly while being close to everything. It is a few km from Fuengirola, a small coastal town that has not less than 7km of beautiful sandy beaches, shopping centers, a water park and much more.
