Located in the gated community of Monte Mayor this stunning  townhouse is nestled in the sought after urbanisation of La Heredia. The urbanisation consists of 53 town houses with excellent views to the sea and mountains. Cobbled streets with charming fountains along with stunning landscaping truly make this a little gem in a tranquil part of Benahavis.

The house was totally renovated in 2022 - private off road parking for 2 cars and a lovely courtyard greets you when entering the property.  Once inside the house a few stairs take you in the large lounge which is full of light due to the many windows and doors which are double glazed. The fully fitted kitchen is located at the back of the lounge - Bosch appliances, 2 large refrigerators and ample space for dining.. The terrace off the lounge gives amazing views both sea and mountains with plenty of space for outdoor dining and entertaining. You will find the 4th bedroom on this level which is currently used as an office with separate bathroom / guest toilet. 

The beautiful staircase takes you to the upper level - 3 bedrooms (2 en-suite) and 1 with a separate bathroom. All bedrooms are of large size and again the large windows and doors make this level extremely bright. All bedrooms have fitted wardrobes ,  AC controls for each room, ceiling fans and stunning views.

Stairs down from the lounge terrace take you to the private salt water heated pool - space for sun loungers and parasols. The large garden (118m2) has artificial grass making this an extremely low maintenance property and a storage room can be found - ideal for storing garden furniture etc.

The high ceilings and neutral colours gives this property a modern contemporary feel and no expense has been spared in the renovation.

A perfect main residence or lock-up-and-leave holiday home in an exclusive and charming gated community......
