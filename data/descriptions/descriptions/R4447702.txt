"Historical villa from the beginning of the S. XX (1905), located in the noble area of the city of Malaga, a privileged residential area of the downtown district of the city. A few meters from the sea, which allows you to walk to the beach.

Perfectly communicated with the city center, a few minutes from the historic center and Pier One. A paradise between the Mediterranean Sea, Avenida de Príes and Paseo de Sancha.

Enjoy an open view of the Bay from its spectacular terraces. An exclusive home makes up this magnificent rehabilitation.

The only house available is a duplex that has a lush private garden with a century-old ficus, which makes it even more special. It has 4 bedrooms with en-suite bathrooms on the ground floor, two of them with access to the wonderful private garden, and the master bedroom with a large en-suite bathroom on the 1st floor, with endless sea views.

Large living room with terrace from which you can access the spectacular 384-meter garden. Kitchen with access to the east garden where you can enjoy summer nights due to its orientation.

2 parking spaces included in the price.

Bet on living in a historic villa full of details that make it a UNIQUE home."
