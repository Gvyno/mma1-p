The Beach Restaurant of Ventura del Mar, located in the south corner in front of the complex with the same name, was built together with the complex and designed by the renowned architect Melvin Villaroel (Puente Romano, Sea Grill, Alcazaba, Alzambra, etc.).
Ventura del Mar is one of the most prestigious and best located beachfront developments in Marbella; an ideal place to enjoy the best of Andalusia and Marbella, with direct access to the boardwalk, and from there to all the sea-side amenities Puerto Banús, San Pedro de Alcántara and Marbella have to offer.
The beach restaurant has access from C / Isabel de Farnesio by a twisting pathway, that was designed to be a peaceful and seamlessly landscaped connection to the seaside and the beach, and from C/ Ventura del Mar by the promenade connecting Puerto Banús with San Pedro de Alcántara. 
The owner applied for the operating license for a Restaurant, currently under process.
