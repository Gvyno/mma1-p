La Mairena...a location which boasts some of the most beautiful landscape on the Costa del Sol. And El Vicario is one of the most desirable apartment complexes on the mountain.
Here is an opportunity to buy a south-east facing 2 bedroom la Mairena penthouse with spectacular panoramic views.The property is located in the very attractive residential complex known as El Vicario, a well-known urbanisation within just 6 minutes drive of the beaches of Marbella East.
Located at the top of a single flight of external stairs (there is no lift) the la Mairena apartment opens into a hallway from where the large living room is accessed to the left and the kitchen to the right. The kitchen overlooks the rear of the complex, where there is designated parking for each resident. with a separate utility room, this kitchen is bright and spacious, and although an update would be very welcome, it is in good enough condition to use as it is.
The living room and dining area is open and bright and has a large window on the exterior wall, and patio doors on the adjacent wall leading to the most wonderfully large terrace, which benefits from breath-taking panoramic views right over the countryside to the coast below as far away as Benalmadena Pueblo.
