Situated in one of the best streets of Sotogrande Alto, this family villa is built over 3 floors and set within a mature garden of over 3000m2.
Sotogrande is one of Southern Spain's most elegant and exclusive residential neighborhoods with a myriad of facilities such as golf, polo, a marina, restaurants and a beachclub.
The house is situated at the base of Sotogrande Alto, close to the security booth and the world renowned Valderrama Golf course.

On the street entrance level we have the living room area with fireplace, kitchen & dining area, all with access to a large covered terrace. There is also a bedroom with en-suite bathroom, a guest bathroom and a garage on this level.
Via stairs there is access to the mezzanine top floor which is ideal as a lounge or study with access to the top terrace. 
Downstairs, which is at garden level, we have a spacious 2nd living room or games room, two bathrooms, another kitchen and 4 bedrooms all with access to the bottom terrace and garden beyond.

The property has a lovely entrance with feature fountain, mature cork oaks on one side of the plot and a grass lawn towards the pool area. The plot at the back of the house is a green zone so the property enjoys increased privacy and views to the surrounding nature.
