Wonderful 2-bedroom apartment with two large terraces and views onto the nature in the quiet Urbanisation Vistalmar (‘sea views') Duquesa Norte. This is a very well maintained, gated community with beautiful communal gardens and several pools. It is located in the rolling hills of Manilva, just a short 5-minute drive from the beach and Duquesa port. 
The property is a spacious 2-bedroom apartment, with semi-open kitchen and 2(!!) terraces – one at the entrance and one accessible from the living room. The apartment is fully furnished and equipped with mosquito nets throughout. It has been renovated and features new windows, a new entrance door & more. It´s located in a quite, closed urbanisation and is ideal for a family. Must be seen!
