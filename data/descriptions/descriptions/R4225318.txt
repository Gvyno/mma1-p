Imagine a residence with rustic charm and stunning views of the sea, just 3.3 km from the urban hustle and bustle and steps from the beach. Located on a 600 m2 plot, this cozy home has been conceived as the ideal refuge for a family. It is distributed over two main floors, with two accesses from the street, one for vehicles and the other for pedestrians.
On the ground floor, an elegant foyer welcomes you to the kitchen-dining room, a summer patio, a formal dining room, a high-ceilinged room with fireplace, an office, two bedrooms and a full bathroom. Highlights include the porch with sea views, the pool and the garden.
Ascending the staircase, you access the upper floor, where a hall connects with the lower level and leads you to:

A double room with a private bathroom.
The master bedroom with private bathroom and dressing room.
The ceramic floors, the double-glazed PVC windows, the air conditioning, the fireplace, the radiators, the gas hot water... every detail has been carefully considered. The property includes a garage for one vehicle, as well as another on the private road. We cannot forget the storage space.
The highlights are the stunning sea views and proximity to the beach. Despite the proximity to the road, the noise level is tolerable and absolute silence reigns inside thanks to the excellent insulation.
