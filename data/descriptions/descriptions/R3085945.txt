Great finca with three bedrooms, two bathrooms, lots of land and private pool. Just on the entrance of Casares village, no difficult roads, easy access, great quiet location and it has the most spectacular views that you will be able to find. There are 3 wells all with water, you get mountain view and a full open view west facing, absolutely gorgeous. The house is legal, but still part of a larger plot, so you could also acquire more land if this is what you wish. Electric not installed, but a point for electric has been paid for, though the current owner only uses electric from his 6 solarpanels and he has new battery system recently installed. Water he does use from the hidralia company, but there is enough water on the land from the wells if this is what you would like to use. Mainly a lot of trees, this land is dryer so not fantastic for fruit trees. Unique location, come and check this out.
