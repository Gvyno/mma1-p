The ground floor was previously a garage but was converted into another living space which currently has 3 decent size bedrooms, family bathroom with shower, 1 lounge with separate kitchen and another open plan kitchen lounge-diner with access to a terrace.

On the first floor, there are a further 5 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, open plan kitchen lounge-diner with access to a balcony.
