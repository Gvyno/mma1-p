A modern and bright semi-detached house, located very close to beach (5 min walk) in the area of Costabella.
It was completely renovated four years ago, fully furnished and equipped in a modern style and high quality materials. Distributed on one floor, with a spacious living room with an open kitchen, with a fireplace and large windows that lead to a very cozy and private terrace with a barbecue.
On the same floor there are two bedrooms and a large bathroom (originally there were two and it was converted into one to have more space with lots of natural light), and a covered terrace with glass curtains and separate access that can be used as an office or a play room.
The house is surrounded by terraces and a tropical garden that allows you to have complete privacy from the neighbors. There is a very large storage room with three sections outside the house allowing you to have plenty of additional space.
There is a solarium on the upper floor.
It does not have a garage but there are no street parking problems since it is a quiet residential area.
It is a few meters from the beach, several restaurants, supermarkets, Las Chapas school etc.
