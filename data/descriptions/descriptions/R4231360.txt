Very spacious duplex penthouse in the mid part of Calahonda with unbeatable panoramic sea views.
The apartment has a very confortable layout with one large ensuite bedroom downstairs and 2 upstairs sharing a second bathroom. There is at the moment a 4th bedroom that has been created by the actual owners taking part of the living-room but it could easily become an extra space for the living-room if preferred. The terrace on this level has also been closed to become part of the living area. The view from the living-room, the kitchen and the 3rd bedroom upstairs is amazing. The kitchen is fully fitted and it could easily be opened to make a nice open space for whom like it better. There is also an extra guest toilet at the entrance. Upstairs, a nice BBQ has been built and an awning installed to enjoy the outside space with the views. The apartment is sold furnished and with 2 storages. The A/C has been installed in all the rooms.
The Urbanization offer a nice swimming pool and a communal room where you can bring you own material to do your gym if you desire.
The apartment needs a bit of updating but it has a great potential and a view that it's hard to equal!!
