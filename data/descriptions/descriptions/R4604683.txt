Charming townhouse in the heart of Alhaurín El Grande, spread over two floors plus a roof terrace. Situated in an excellent location, just a few steps away from all amenities such as shops, restaurants, supermarkets, and schools.

On the ground floor, this house features a spacious open-plan living and dining area, a fully fitted kitchen with access to a small patio, and a complete bathroom with a shower. Upstairs, there are three ample bedrooms with another bathroom, and from one of the rooms, you can access the roof terrace offering delightful views of the town and the valley.

The roof terrace benefits from a room currently used as a storage space and toolshed but, with a minor renovation, could be transformed into a summer kitchen, an office, or another creative area.

This property is an excellent choice, combining comfort and charm, all within short walking distance of the town centre.
