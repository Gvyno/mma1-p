We are really pleased to present this beautiful villa on the third line of the beach in Costabella.
The house is distributed in two levels. And it is south facing.
On the ground floor we access the spacious and cozy living room through a hall. The kitchen on the right side is very functional and has a separate laundry room.
On the left side there is a bedroom and a second living room that can be transformed into a fourth bedroom through which we access a generously sized pool.
We access through a spiral staircase to the second floor where we find 2 large bedrooms that share a terrace from where we have beautiful views of the sea and the mountains.
The property also has a garage for one car.
Costabella is well known by having the best beach in Marbella and where you will enjoy a wide gastronomic offer, both traditional beach bars such as Copacabana and Las Flores and the most exclusive beach clubs on the Costa Del Sol such as Bonos Beach, Looma or Dune.
We also have Supermarkets, Cafes, Pharmacy, Playground, Dog Park and more Services. But the most important thing is that everything is less than a 10-minute walk away.
There is no doubt that this is an excellent opportunity to improve your quality of life.
Don't forget to book your visit with us today...tomorrow may already be too late.
