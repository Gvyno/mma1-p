INCREDIBLE LOCATION.Set in the foothills of the beautiful Crestellina Mountain, just 3km from the village of Casares, with great access. Close to all amenities but far away from all the hustle and buzzle.South facing position with views to the conuntry and mountains, towards to Gibraltar and the African Coast. The property consists of a main house, 2 guest cottages with private pools. Providing good rental income. The property has further potential for more development and the area is suitable for horses. It is run as a rural accomodation, and has huge rental potential for many other ideas. Must be seen.
