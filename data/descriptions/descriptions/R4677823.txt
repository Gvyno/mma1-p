We are very  pleased to present this magnificent semi-detached house located just 80 meters from the best beach in Marbella where we find the most exclusive beach clubs such as Looma, Bonos Beach or Dune among others.
The house is divided into 2 floors plus a basement and Solarium.
It is also almost surrounded by a beautiful garden that we can admire from the porch or the 2 terraces on the upper floors.
The property has been completely renovated and decorated with exquisite taste, in fact the furniture and fixtures are brand new so you can move in or rent it immediately.
On the first floor we find a cozy living room with a dining room connected to the modern and practical kitchen. From here a staircase connects us to the upper floor and the basement-garage.
From the bedrooms on the upper floor we have beautiful views of the Mediterranean and we will enjoy unforgettable evenings in the solarium.
The area has a great projection, just 200 meters away is the most exclusive development on the coast, called Dunique.
We also have all kinds of services that we can access by walking in less than 10 minutes,
The airport is 30 minutes away by car and Marbella is only 6 minutes away.
