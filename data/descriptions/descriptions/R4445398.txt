Built in 2005, but practically new and probably one of the nicest two bedroom apartments on La Cala Hills. With two renewed and luxury upgraded bathroom, a new kitchen with all new appliances like dishwasher, fridge, hob and oven, new air-conditioning, new washing machine etc. The ample 24m2 terrace is fitted with glass curtains and sunscreens and shows lovely views over the tropical gardens, pool and surroundings. It only needs the turn of a key to move in. The top quality and tastefully furnishing is subject to negotiation.
