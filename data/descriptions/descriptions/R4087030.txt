In the Guadalmina Alta area, especially amongst the golf club members, this is one of the most iconic buildings. Located just behind the 18th tee box & the 8th green, this apartment is a golfers paradise. You can relax on your terrace with panoramic golf views, soak up the sun & enjoy the peace & tranquillity this apartment has to offer.

The building itself represents a very small community of only twelve apartments, all of them terraced in a way that offers maximum privacy to each of the owners. This particular apartment is not overlooked in any way, despite being on the edge of town, a stones throw from the golf club, the current owners are keen to emphasise how quiet & peaceful their apartment is throughout the year. 

The apartment was reformed six years ago, so all utilities are new and up-to-date. However, despite currently being a beautiful two bedroom apartment, with two ensuite bathrooms. This apartment is certainly large enough to offer its new owners a three bedroom layout, with loads of room left over to enjoy open-plan living and that 70 meter long terrace.

Guadalmina Alta is unquestionably one of the most popular places to live in the Marbella / San Pedro areas, with flagship urbanisations like this one commanding a premium. There have been a few developments adjacent to this apartment, that mean the most popular parts of San Pedro´s Old Town are now easier to access by foot or by car. 

This apartment has on-street communal parking HOWEVER, the current owner has secured a two car garage & is willing to purchase this on behalf of any potential new buyer, if indeed it would help the sale. The garage is directly beneath the apartment terrace, seconds from the front door.
