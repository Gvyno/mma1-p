IMMACULATE, bright and spacious independant villa, in front line golf position, but unusually on a community of 4 houses, sharing electric entry gate, communal driveway and garden-pool area.  Lovingly maintained and partly refurbished by the owners, this beautiful house boasts many outstanding features such as a fabulous rustic beamed lounge-dining room ceiling, feature tower in the hallway and the most amazing open panoramic views of the golf course.  A covered porchway, leads into the villa´s hallway and then into the stunning lounge-dining room with 2 sets of patio doors leading to  the full width covered terrace.  Also, a  recently fully fitted kitchen, utility room and cloakroom.  At garden  level we find the master bedroom with ensuite bathroom and dressing area, plus 2 further double bedrooms and family bathroom.  There is also a basement currently used for storage.  The property has its own private garden with terrace, lawn, plants and trees and, of course, easy access to the communal infinity pool and sunbathing area.  There is a 2 car parking area at the front of the house, which could be covered to make a carport if desired.  All located within a very short drive of local shops, bars and restaurants and only around 1km to the beach.   The property is sold with many quality furnishings also.  A perfect home or holiday home.
