A bright and sunny south-facing apartment in the pretty urbanisation of Benamara.  This top floor apartment has a large living /dining room and a cosy, traditional kitchen.  There is an exceptionally large terrace which is south facing and enjoys the sun all day long.  The apartment has 2 bedrooms with 2 bathrooms, one of which is ensuite.

The apartment is the perfect holiday home and is a short walk to the large park area of Benamara and the communal swimming pool.  The beach and the beach bar of Salduna is also less than a 5 minute walk.

A beautiful property that needs to be seen to be appreciated.
