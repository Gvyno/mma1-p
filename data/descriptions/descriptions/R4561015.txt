Nine Lions Residences is a sought after and well secured urbanisation with heated pools, gym, saunas, 24/7 security and smooth concierge services. All together Nine Lions residences has 53 unique apartments and only nine of them are Duplex Penthouses. This new urbanisation was sold out last year.
This unique Duplex Penthouse enjoys excellent privacy. One of the bedrooms is facing La Concha mountain and towards the Turtle lake. The main windows are facing south with breath taking panoramic sea views. This Duplex Penthouse has three spacious bedrooms and all of them have suite bathrooms and lots of storage room. The Master bedroom is on the top floor with a wonderful solarium and a Drop Jacuzzi.
The apartment has a unique layout and exceptional quality of finish including appliances from Gaggenau and bathrooms by Villeroy & Boch. Partially covered terraces are designed to make the most of the 300 says of sunshine, while floor-to-ceiling windows flood the interiors with natural light.
Situated just above vibrant Puerto Banús and overlooking three stunning golf courses, this development enjoys a superb location. Many restaurants, bars and cafés line the Port, offering a selection of high-quality international cuisine. El Lago de las Tortugas just next to the development provides a peaceful backdrop for a picnic and the beautiful sandy beaches of Puerto Banús are just a few minutes drive.
The communal Clubhouse with its two heated swimming pools, spa and fitness area is in the centre of the urbanisation and a third generous swimming pool lies in the west, nestled amongst the fresh, green landscaped gardens.
