If you are looking to run a rural Bed and Breakfast in beautiful location then this is for you.

Nestled in the hills of Guaro this property is Rural Touism on steroids.  Whislt sitting in the hills it is only a 10 minute drive to the village and a short walk to a local restaurant.  The property feels tranquil and would make a prefer retreat.

A visit is necessary to walk around the property and feel the ambience of the location.
