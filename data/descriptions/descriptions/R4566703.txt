Beautiful Duplex Penthouse with large terrace and sea views.
Exceptional location next to the Estepona Marina, a step away from the New Estepona Paseo Marítimo and the beaches, and a very short distance from the Historic Center.

House with three bedrooms, two bathrooms and a toilet, with a spacious living room that gives access to the terrace with great views.

It is located on the second floor, without elevator.

Magnificent opportunity to acquire a penthouse with a terrace, garage and attached storage room, in Estepona, at an unbeatable price in the area.

It can be visited at any time, and it will be available for sale from December 2023.
Do not hesitate and ask us for an appointment to come see it and reserve it before it disappears from the market. You will love it.
