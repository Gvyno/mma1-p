Totally refurbished, this very special, luxury two bedroom, two bathroom apartment with expansive roof terrace/solarium is located within La Cartuja del Golf, Estepona.

Located on the second floor of phase 1 of the development, this apartment has undergone extensive refurbishment over the past few years.  

The well distributed accommodation consists of a larger than average living/dining room with beautiful feature fireplace housing an attractive log burner.  Newly installed french doors open onto the spacious terrace with ample space for dining and relaxing and lovely views over the communal pools and pristine gardens.  Stairs lead up to the solarium/roof terrace.

The fully fitted modern kitchen was installed by a British company.  It features sleek white units and dark granite work surfaces.  The laundry area has been cleverly opened up to provide a light and spacious breakfast area.

The master bedroom is a great size with direct access to the terrace, it features plenty of fitted wardrobe space, a dressing area and beautiful en suite bathroom.  This bathroom has been fully tiled with beige walls and floor tiles and has a large, modern walk-in shower.

Bedroom two is another good size double with a small balcony and views to the Atalaya Golf Course.  There are fitted wardrobes and an adjoining family bathroom with grey marble walls and floor tiles and a modern bathroom suite.

The roof terrace is a real bonus!  This exceptional space has been cleverly divided to incorporate both shaded and unshaded areas, a built in BBQ, useful sink and plenty of storage.  The washing machine is also housed here.  From this elevated position you are able to enjoy great golf views from one side and beautiful pool and sea views on the other.
