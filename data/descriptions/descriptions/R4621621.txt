Excellent frontline golf apartment.

Two large double bedrooms, master ensuite and a second large guest bathroom
The kitchen has enough room for dining a area, plus separate utility room
The apartment has a very large lounge / living area, large enough to accommodate formal dining and separate relaxation spaces.
The terrace is accessed from the lounge and the Master bedroom and has magnificent unobstructed views over the 17th green at RCGG (Guadalmina Golf).

Guadalcantara Golf is unquestionably one of the finest urbanisations in the Guadalmina Alta area. The residents have managed this twenty year old development extremely well, resulting in a beautifully presented building, manicured gardens, spotless communal pools and facilities unrivalled in this locality. 

For buyers looking for something with easy access to local facilities, Guadalcantara is it...... You can walk to San Pedro town in fifteen minutes, cycle to the beach in 15 minutes and drive buggy to the golf club in five minutes.

This property is empty, has only a few items of furniture in place, so the owner is ready to move on and has priced the property for what they hope will be a quick sale.
