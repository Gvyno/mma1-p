The club house, driving range and all sports facilities are within walking distance of the property.

The villa is situated in a prime residential street and enjoys a prized site in an elevated position with spectacular views of the golf course and the sea. The villa stands on a plot of 1000 m2 of which 470 m2 is the total built area and 56 m2 is in terraces.

The property, one of a kind, which was built in 2006, has some beautiful and user friendly design features. The quality of material and finish is obvious throughout the villa, showing that attention to detail and care was taken with selection and installation. The villa features designer ceramic tiles throughout and the unique fireplace adds a special character to the living room. The master suite has a large walk in closet and two terraces with views to the golf course and sea from both. The closets throughout the house were designed and fitted by The Metropolitan Closet Company.
