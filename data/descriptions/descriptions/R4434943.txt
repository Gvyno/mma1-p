This house in the pure heart of the Los Boliches neighborhood, was originally a nearby district that has ended up being part of Fuengirola, so it is like a town with a fishing port within a city.

A distinctive feature of this area are its narrow streets and picturesque houses typical of a fishing neighborhood. It is a very lively area with numerous restaurants, bars and shops. However, one of its main attractions is Los Boliches beach, with fine, dark sand, and also awarded the Blue Flag and the 'Q' for Tourist Quality.

The Boliches area has its own Renfe commuter and intercity bus stop.

The construction is a Bi-Family house, divided into two homes, it consists of 3 bedrooms, 2 quite large bathrooms and a toilet, balconies in the living room and main bedroom area, with a large community terrace on the upper floor of the building, ideal for a family with children or a vacation home, right next to the Boliches church and the Cercanias stop.
