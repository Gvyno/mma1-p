Beautifully renovated high-quality apartment with large private terrace in the central area of Lagunas - Fuengirola. The flat shares the building with only 3 neighbors, so the monthly fee is minimal. As we go up one stair we enter a bright home with an open floor-plan between the kitchen and living room. In the living room we find a fireplace and a spacious balcony facing the street to the west. On the other side of the room, we have the beautiful kitchen with high-gloss doors combined with a modern industrial tone. Plenty of bench space and a place for a breakfast table. Next to the kitchen, we come out to a glassed-in part of the private terrace, perfect for the hot summer days when you are looking for shade from the sun. There is also an uncovered part where the sun looks down during the day. Further into the apartment we find 3 spacious bedrooms, 2 of which face the street and one faces the patio. All with built-in wardrobes. There is a beautiful bathroom with bathtub adjacent to the bedrooms and a bathroom with shower adjacent to the entrance.
This is a newly renovated apartment of the highest quality with proximity to all the amenities of the center such as grocery stores, restaurants, bars and transport. It takes about 10 minutes to walk to the train station and we can find the sea in 13 minutes. Call us for a viewing.
