Large, bright, two bedroom, west facing, ground floor apartment within walking distance of all amenities and with direct access to the beach.

The apartment has a large lounge with direct access to a private covered terrace and a garden, and enjoys marvellous views of the gardens, pool and sea.

There is an oversize master bedroom, with fitted wardrobes and an ensuite bathroom; there is a further double bedroom with separate bathroom.

The kitchen is fully equipped and there is a separate utility and laundry room.

The apartment would benefit from an upgrade, however it is a very well positioned apartment in a spectacular location.
