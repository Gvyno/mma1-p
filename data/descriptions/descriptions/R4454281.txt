Magnificent villa with well-cut garden and lovely views of Mijas and Fuengirola's landscape. 
Now we have the pleasure of presenting this beautiful villa located just outside Fuengirola with 10 min drive to the sea and 20 min to the airport. The urbanisation Doña Pilar is a lush neighbourhood that was established in the 1980s, although our nice villa is from 2004. Here we enjoy the tranquility of nature and the wonderful views and sunset to the southwest. The villa is located in a cul-de-sac which makes the traffic here minimal. 
The villa stands on a plot of 1500m2 and here you find a nice pool with shower, a garage for 2 cars and many secluded areas as the house is elevated above its neighbours. 
The villa consists of 3 floors and is distributed in 4 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms and a guest toilet. On the entrance floor we have a large kitchen, living room, 2 bedrooms, a bathroom with bathtub and a toilet. 
On the second floor we find a huge master bedroom with en-suite bathroom and access to a giant terrace towards the southwest. On the same level there is also a smaller bedroom that is currently used as an office. Next to this office is a storage room.
If we continue up in the house, we come to the house's roof terrace which is both wind and privacy protected. A perfect place to enjoy Friday drinks before the weekend begins!
