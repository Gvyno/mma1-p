Double commercial premises (with two deeds) in a very good location, exclusive use of the parking area and use of the community pool.

Its last use has been as a restaurant. It could be redone as a restaurant or like any other business as it has commercial license

It also offers the potential of making it into three residences (plans available).

It is a very interesting investment!!
