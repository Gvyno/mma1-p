A short distance from the centre of Alora is this lovely country house of 183m2. The plot of 1680 m2 is fully enclosed by a fence and can be entered through a nice double gate. Access to the plot is paved and the property is located on a cul-de-sac. A nice quiet spot in the valley next to Alora. 
The accommodation has two floors. The ground floor offers a spacious living room, living kitchen and garage with shower and toilet. The stairs lead to the upper floor with 3 bedrooms, bathroom and a modern kitchen. The bedrooms have fitted wardrobes and air conditioning. 
With a small operation, the second floor can be transformed into a very spacious landing with bathroom and three bedrooms, allowing the modern kitchen to be used on the ground floor. 

At the front, there is also a BBQ area and covered bar/terrace attached to the house. At this bar there is also an authentic bread oven.
 There is an alberque equipped for swimming and the finca has an excellent working water source. City water is available but not used by the current owner.
The installed solar panels and its own water source ensure that daily living costs are kept to a minimum. This property is ready for the future!


Included in the sale is also a very charming orchard and vegetable garden planted with productive lemon trees, olive trees and a variety of other fruit trees.
 Within this plot there is a small building of about 30m2 currently used as a storage room, but with potential for use as a stable or perhaps even a small studio.

The location and beautiful open views over the lush landscape of the Guadalhorce Valley that can be enjoyed from this property cannot be overemphasised.
