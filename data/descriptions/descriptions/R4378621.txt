This is a wonderful penthouse with large terraces and stunning views. The property has 2 floors, on the lower level there are two Bedrooms and two bathrooms, one of them en suite. Large living/dining room leading onto a bright spacious terrace. Plenty of light with great views. Fully fitted kitchen with Siemens appliances. On the upper level is the master bedroom witha large en suite bathroom with walkin shower, large bath tub, separate toilet and bidet and double sink. Also there are two terraces, one of them with sea views and the other one with the jacuzzi.

A great oppurtunity to buy a 3 bedroom penthouse in La Alzambra
