A beautiful 3 bedroom 3 bathroom duplex apartment with panoramic sea and mountain views and within walking distance of local amenities and the beach. This apartment ticks all of the boxes. When entering the apartment the first thing you see through the open plan kitchen and lounge is the amazing sea view. The lounge / kitchen has access to one of the terraces via 2 sets of patio doors. Also on this level is 1 of the bedrooms and a bathroom. Upstairs there are 2 good size double bedrooms. Both of them are En-suite and both have a private terrace. Up to the next level and we have an amazing roof terrace with Panoramic views of the sea and mountains. You also have an underground parking space and the urbanisation has a communal swimming pool and gardens and a play area for younger children. The apartment is in excellent condition throughout and is very much a blank canvas for a new owner to put their stamp on. For more information or to arrange a viewing contact us anytime!
