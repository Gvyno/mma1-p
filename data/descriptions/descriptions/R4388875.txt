LAST 2 AVAILABLE VILLAS 
Located in the heart of Puerto Banús, Marbella&#039;s most exclusive and luxurious area, this stunning residential project boasts five unique detached villas. Surrounded by socio-cultural and scenic richness, these homes offer unlimited opportunities for leisure and relaxation. 

This residential complex is nestled just a few meters from the beautiful Duque beach, easily accessible through a serene stroll. With Europe&#039;s most renowned port and diverse services at your fingertips, the location offers an unparalleled experience. 

The villas are part of an exclusive new residential project on the Costa del Sol, marking a significant leap in our commitment to meticulous design and detailed construction. Designed for year-round living, the outdoor landscaping is carefully curated to harmonize with the surrounding vegetation. 

The villas extend over four floors, featuring four bedrooms and six bathrooms, including a solarium and a customizable basement leading to a private garage with space for three cars. All homes face south, basking in sunlight throughout the year. 

These homes are designed for indoor and outdoor enjoyment. From the outside, the terraces offer a solarium with a jacuzzi and a porch with a barbecue that seamlessly extends the living room into the garden, complete with a landscaped project and private swimming pool. Inside, underfloor heating in all rooms and a living room fireplace ensure a cozy atmosphere, while premium qualities such as home automation systems for controlling air conditioning and lighting, and security features like video surveillance cameras and alarms add to the comfort and safety of the residence. 

The project is set to be completed by October 2024, offering a unique opportunity to experience exceptional living in one of Marbella's most sought-after locations.
