A stunning townhouse built on two storeys and with a huge private sunny terrace of 39 m2, located in the heart of Fuengirola town within walking distance to all amenities, bars and restaurants, and only 5 minutes walking to the beach. No better location. This famous urbanisation is really well maintained and offers secure gates all around and a community parking only for the owners of Pueblo López. The house itself comes with a good size lounge with fireplace and dining area, fitted kitchen and guest toilet on the ground level, while upstairs there are two double bedrooms and a beautiful bathroom. On the patio outside there is also a built-in storage room. If you want to live in the centre of town with all shops on your doorsteps and still in being in a quiet and peaceful urbanisation, then this is what you are looking for.
