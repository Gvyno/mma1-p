In the sought-after Saladillo Benamara residential area, 200 meters from the Mediterranean Sea west of Marbella's glamorous Puerto Banus, you will find this beautiful villa with five bedrooms, its own swimming pool, and a stunning view of the water from the rooftop terrace.

The house has been refreshed and well-maintained since its construction in 1970 and offers 150 quality-conscious square meters of living space facing south, along with a garage.

The property benefits from a brand new kitchen that is open to the living room, creating a welcoming space for cozy moments with family and friends gathered around the fireplace.

Everything is on one level, and each room has its own separate air conditioning, built-in closets, and ample natural light due to its favorable orientation.

The 500 sqm plot is bathed in sunlight from morning until evening, offering complete privacy. The large tiled outdoor areas surrounding the villa's pool feature multiple covered and open terraces.

From the garden, a staircase leads up to the rooftop, where you can enjoy a 70 sqm terrace, providing the perfect setting for long summer evenings filled with barbecues, good wine, and beautiful sunsets over the mountains in Estepona.

You will be located on the desirable waterside of the New Golden Mile coastal road, just a few minutes' peaceful and level walk from shopping facilities, restaurants, and, of course, the local beach, where Pepe's Chiringuito serves the catch of the day and plays relaxing chill-out rhythms.

If you want to visit Marbella or Estepona, it is only a 10-minute drive, and the journey to and from the airport takes just 45 minutes.

It is worth mentioning that the house generates €46,000 annually in rental income, thanks to its ten sleeping accommodations, its proximity to the beach, and its walking distance to all daily necessities — as well as the short drive to and from some of the coast's most popular points of interest, such as Puerto Banus, Benahavis, and the two historic city centers of Estepona and Marbella. <a href=https://www.bargainandalucia.dk/tvangssalg target=_blank ><img src=https://www.bargainandalucia.dk/resales-online-property-costa-del-sol.png alt=Bargain-Andalucia ></a>
