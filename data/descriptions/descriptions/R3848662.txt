Whilst the original properties date from 1970s, the property has been extensively renovated in a quirky and original style, whilst staying true to the property&#039;s 'country house' roots.

The main house comprises three bedrooms and two bathrooms, a 1950s style kitchen, with diner.  There is a lounge with double heigh ceilings and an open fire, as well as a separate formal dining room with Scandinavian wood burner.  The property has many original features, including a 'folly' balcony area overlooking the pool. 

The swimming pool is orientated to the south and enjoys all day sunshine.  Other parts of the plot have east and south east orientation.

There is an additional guest house with two bedrooms, and it&#039;s own kitchen.  There is a plant room for the pool equipment as well as a log store.
