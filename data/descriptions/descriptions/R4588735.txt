Notably, the neighborhood is undergoing a remarkable transformation with substantial upgrades. This vital coastal route - Istan Road, currently narrow and lacking hard shoulders, is set for a major upgrade by Junta de Andalucía and Marbella council. 
The 4 million EUR project involves expanding the road, adding hard shoulders, pavements, and roundabouts to enhance safety. New street lighting and palm trees will also adorn the route.

This townhouse beautifully embodies contemporary living in a peaceful setting and is part of a community looking towards the future. Don&#039;t miss this opportunity to make it your home in the sought-after Golden Mile area of Marbella.
