This cosy two bedroom, two bathroom townhouse in Nueva Andalucia enjoys magical views over the picturesque Andalucian pueblo style village of El Naranjal. 
Walking in through the front door into the pretty living room and kitchen, both leading out to a charming and private patio garden. Upstairs, you will find two en suite bedrooms with built in wardrobes. Both bedrooms enjoy open views of the golf valley with both La Concha and the sea in the distance.
The close proximity to Lago de las Tortugas ("the Turtle Lake") makes the area a nice spot for being out in the nature with some of the best golf courses on the Costa del Sol on your door step.
The urbanization is a gated community with nicely manicured gardens and a communal pool as well as a tennis court.
The south facing aspect of this townhouse maximises  sunshine, making this home a little gem.
El Naranjal is also close to all amenities, transport and schools.
