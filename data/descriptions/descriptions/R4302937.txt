Beautiful 1-bedroom apartment in Benahavis.
We are welcomed to the apartment by a spacious hall with a large fitted closet and views to all rooms.
The open-style kitchen is fully fitted with modern appliances and share space with the bright living room. It also has a dedicated office area. From here we access the private terrace that also connects with the bedroom.
The bedroom is very bright due to the large glass doors that it enjoys and has large fitted wardrobes too. There is a full family bathroom with bathtub
The residential is gated and has a swimming pool.
The ideal location of Benahavis, situated between Marbella, Estepona and Ronda makes it a perfect place to live. Just a mere 15nminutes´s drive to the closest beach and its amenities and 25minutes to Puerto Banus and its buzzling lifestyle. Surrounded by golf courses and international schools and of course, plenty of nature!
