A PICTURE TELLS A THOUSAND WORDS!!!

Look at these! A three-bedroom, 2 bathroom, semi-detached villa in a quiet urbanization less
than a 5-minute drive to the bustling port of La Duquesa. Modern kitchen and new
double-glazed windows throughout. An ample upstairs terrace with panoramic views and a
great outdoor entertainment area downstairs. Communal pool completes the picture.
