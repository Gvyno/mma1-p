Superb opportunity for a 2 bedroom  apartment located in one of the best buildings within Puertomarina. Not only does this apartment offer a large terrace facing the beach with afternoon sun but also has another terrace looking straight out at the marina!  On the main level on entering there is a hallway which gives access to an independent American style kitchen, the hallway also leads on to the lounge/dining area which leads onto the sunny terrace with beach and sea views. Also on this level there is a guest bathroom and main bedroom (with access to terrace looking at marina), also with en-suite bathroom.  This property has use of a lovely rooftop solarium with infinity pool. This level can also be accessed by the community lift. The property is being sold with underground parking. Great buy for the price....viewings highly recommended!
