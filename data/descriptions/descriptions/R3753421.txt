Location, location, location!

The location doesn't get better than that if you want to live in the center of Fuengirola. It is located in a residential street . It is a very sought after area of Fuengirola, where there rarely are properties for sale.
This wonderful townhouse is located 300 meters from the beach and a few meters from the train station, which goes to Malaga center.
Next to the property you can find all the amenities, restaurants, supermarkets, Swedish school and many more.
It has a wide terrace where they will be able to enjoy moments of tranquility.
That property is going to be sold very fast so do not miss the opportunity to view it. It has been decorated very tastefully and to high standard so it deserves to be seen.
Do not wait more to call to arrange a visit."
