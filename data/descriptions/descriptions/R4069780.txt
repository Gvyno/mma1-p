Beautiful beachfront townhouse in Los Granados Playa, Estepona

In one of the luxurious and private urbanisations of Estepona, we find this wonderful 3-bed townhouse. 

The property has 3 levels distributed as follows: 

On the ground floor, we have a fully fitted kitchen with a large laundry room, a guest toilet, a cloakroom and a spacious living-dining room which leads to the 25m2 covered terrace and a small garden. 

On the top floor, we find the master bedroom with an en suite bathroom. This room has a lovely terrace with sea views and enjoys a southwest orientation. On the same floor, we have 2 other double bedrooms which share a bathroom. 

Finally, on the -1 floor, we have a 16m2 storage room and access to a large 2 bay garage space. 

Los Granados Playa is very private and luxurious urbanisation. With lovely communal areas, swimming pool, tennis and padel courts, and a Gym. 

The location is fantastic not only for being next to the beach but also because it is close to beach bars, and restaurants and you have Marbella and Estepona within a 10min drive.
