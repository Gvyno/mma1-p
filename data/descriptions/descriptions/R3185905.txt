Unfinished structure distributed over 4 floors with parking on the lower level for 6 plus cars, located in Benahavis Pueblo.  The foot-print of the entire structure measures approximately 152m².  This structure was built around 2004 but never got completed.  The original plans submitted were to construct 6 x 1 bedroom apartments, 2 apartments on each floor with a build size of approximately 60m² for each unit.  This gives a total build size including the parking of around 548m² this does not include the area on the top floor terrace. The original plans included a rooftop swimming pool.  It is now understood that the building regulations have changed in Benahavis, the minimum build for an apartment in Benahavis pueblo is now 100m² which means that new plans would need to be submitted to construct either three larger apartments on each of three floors or to remove the existing structure and apply for permission to construct a Townhouse or detached house etc.  Great investment opportunity!
