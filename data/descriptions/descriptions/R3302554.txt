Fantastic new finca / villa with high level of finishing located in a quiet area and with a beautiful view over the sea and the mountains. 
Entrance through gates where there is space on the driveway for many cars. At the front of the house is a large south facing terrace where you have a panoramic view over the sea and the rural surroundings. The house is surrounded by a large garden and next to it is the large plot full of fruit trees such as banana, orange, garnet and much more.
The villa has been completely rebuilt and beautiful materials have been used. The entire rustic house has a high, beamed ceiling. On entering you enter into a sitting room with a fireplace and a fully equipped (dining) kitchen. A bathroom with shower and various storage rooms.
Large doors give access to a space that can be arranged entirely according to your own insight. For example a large sitting room of 100m2 or several bedrooms with bathrooms. Behind it are 3 spacious bedrooms and a bathroom.
The entire house is double glazed, has electric blinds and from every room you have a beautiful view of the surroundings.
All this is just 5 minutes drive from the beach and shops and in 10 minutes you are in the cozy old town of Estepona or San Pedro de Alcántara.
The combination of new, rural, quiet and size can be called unique.
