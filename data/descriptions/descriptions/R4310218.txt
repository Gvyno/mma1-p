Welcome to your own private oasis in El Paraiso! This beautiful 4 bed 4.5 bath villa is full of character, privacy, with plenty of space for you and your family to enjoy.

The single level villa is set in an extensive, very private and mature garden with a large swimming pool. The villa has been partly reformed and there is the opportunity for a new owner to put their own stamp on the property by making further renovations. You could even add an additional level to the house, or a developer / investor could divide the plot and build two houses. The kitchen has been completely reformed into a modern, luxurious space, with plenty of room for cooking and dining and it has access directly into the garden. There is a large and modernised covered terrace off the lounge / dining room which is perfect for entertaining which looks on to the garden and pool. 

The house is close to shops, golf and schools and would make a fantastic family residence or holiday home.
