Discover the magic of living in a place where every sunrise is a canvas of peace and every sunset is illuminated by 20 cast iron lanterns that whisper stories of yesteryear. With 120 m² of comfort, the main house offers you three bedrooms to dream in and a bathroom to revitalise you. Next door, a promise for the future: another unfinished house of 128 m², with three bedrooms, two bathrooms and spaces waiting to be completed with your vision.

Feel the freedom of your 24,000 m² of land, breathe in the freshness of two natural wells and share unforgettable moments around a barbecue that promises to be the heart of your gatherings. The fireplace in each living room is the symbol of a warm and cosy home, and the kitchens are ready to awaken your culinary senses.

Built with a double wall that promises solidity and isolation, my structure stands on fenced grounds, dotted with 14 palm trees, 8 coconut trees that give you a living landscape. Life here is an ode to tranquillity, where the only hurry is the one you decide to be in. Water will not be a concern, with a facility that does not burden your pocket and a swimming pool that invites you to summer leisure under the sun.

We know that a home speaks louder than a thousand words. That is why we invite you to visit this estate where every corner tells a story and every detail is waiting to be part of yours.

Come and visit me, and let yourself be enchanted by the life we can build together.
