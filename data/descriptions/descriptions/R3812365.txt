Urban building for sale in the heart of Elviria right on the Avenida de Las Cumbres commercial street  -  The property was built on its own plot of urban land of 1.623m2 on two levels. On the street level we find a reception and ten offices with a common kitchen ad two bathrooms. On the upper level with separate entrance there are two large holiday apartments with four and five bedrooms. The building has been painted outdoor and nicely renovated inside two years ago and giving currently 6 to 7% return. It has huge potential as it is easily converted into an even more profitable business like nursing home, medical centre or small shopping centre. Bus station, taxi station, pharmacy, supermarket and all local amenities are literal steps away.
