Opportunity in Faro de Calaburras
We offer you this new exclusive opportunity in the urbanisation Faro de Calaburras. It is a detached corner villa with a large and sunny garden that in addition to its two bedrooms, bathroom, kitchen, large terrace and living room, has a totally independent studio that you can rent if you consider it appropriate.
This villa has an interesting plot with barbecue that you can use if you wish to make a private swimming pool apart from the one you already have in the urbanization. Due to its southeast orientation it is a very luminous property that has a terrace of approximately 20 m2 with direct access from the living room and that has an area with a small bar that will allow you to celebrate events with friends and family or simply have a cool drink while you enjoy the sun of the coast.
