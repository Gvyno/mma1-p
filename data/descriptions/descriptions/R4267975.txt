Alhaurín de la Torre is a municipality located in the province of Málaga, Andalusia, Spain between the Metropolitan Area of Málaga and the Guadalhorce Valley region, next to the Costa del Sol. The village sits in the Sierra de Mijas, belonging to the Cordillera Penibética and is watered by the river Guadalhorce. It borders the municipalities of Málaga, Cártama, Torremolinos, Mijas, Benalmádena and Alhaurín el Grande.
