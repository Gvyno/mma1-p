Fantastic opportunity to buy a very spacious house with panoramic views, private garden and a huge garage for several cars. This is an ideal family house to live all year around in a very quiet environment. Built over 2 levels plus the garage, it's an upside down house with, on the higher level, a bright living-room with bow-window, and fireplace, a separate dining-room that communicates with the independent kitchen and a guest toilet in the entrance, and the 4 bedrooms (2 en suite) and 3 bathrooms are downstairs with a direct access to the private garden. The living-room and the dining room enjoy panoramic views to the mountain, countryside and the sea. From both, you can access the terrace facing east and the garden on the lower level with a spirale outside staircase. The kitchen is fully fitted and has a back laundry space. All the rooms are very spacious and distributed around a central patio to give more light to the house. The house has A/C and wooden floors in all the rooms (except bathrooms). The bedrooms are large enough for a bed + desk for children and they all have built-in wardrobes and electric shutters. From this level you can also reach the garage on the lower level, from the inside or from the garden. There is no communal pool but room for one in the private garden. The Urbanization is very close to the German school and a few shops and restaurants and about 15mn drive to the beautiful sandy Beach of Elviria, Marbella
