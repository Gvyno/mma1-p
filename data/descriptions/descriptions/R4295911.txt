A great opportunity to acquire a spacious penthouse with magnificent sea views at a below market price.  The penthouse is situated in the prestigious area of Rio Real, near to the golf course and next to the Incosol hotel which is currently undergoing refurbishment and is due to open again soon. The potential of this property is huge. It has been used as a holiday home for the current owners for many years and has never been rented out. It is in quite good condition but this could be something truly spectacular with some reforms.  The penthouse is very spacious and also offers a lovely large terrace with panoramic sea views. The bedrooms are also spacious with high ceilings, ensuite bathrooms and built in wardrobes.  Plenty of big windows make the interior lovely and bright and the views are from almost every room of the property. It has underground parking and storage room, and is being offered at a very good price considering the size and the area.
