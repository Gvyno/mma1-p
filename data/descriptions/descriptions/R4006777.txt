Huge Price reduction Well established business of over 30 years! Bar & Restaurant with an open terrace and ample indoor space with fabulous sea views. Located within easy walking distance of the beach, local transport and other commercial areas, this long established business has operated very successfully for over 30 years. The current owner wishes to retire. The restaurant comes with a fully fitted kitchen, large bar and indoor seating area, ladies and gentlemen's restrooms and large open (or covered if preferred) terrace. 

The premise does require refurbishment, but is priced accordingly. There is plenty of parking locally, as it is in the heart of a very busy residential and holiday area. The perfect opportunity to acquire fabulous commercial space with great income and investment potential.
