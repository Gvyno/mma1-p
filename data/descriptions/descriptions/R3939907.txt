At present the property is built as 150m2 living accomodation on the upper floor comprised as follows.Large Lounge with dining area, fireplace (wood burning) Kitchen of a very good size and utility room.The lounge has patio doors on to 80m2 terrace with fantastic views of the valley and mountains. Three double bedrooms (all ensuite) plus a bathroom off the lounge,

The lower floor has windows fitted but is used as a 230m2 garage with room for many cars. The immediate area around the house is garden with palm, Olive and.
 a couple of fruit trees, orange and apricot and walnut. The property has a pedestrian access to the back door and a drive accessed by electric gates to the underground area .
