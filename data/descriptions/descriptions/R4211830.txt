This fantastic location is an absolute gift, a short walking distance to the sandy Elviria
beaches, next to the most glamorous beach bars, hotel beach clubs, traditional
chiringuitos with the true Andalusian flavours, and all that with abundance of amenities and
services such as pharmacy, schools, supermarkets, etc. ... everything one might need to
live as a permanent home, or as a holiday property. This independent Villa plot amounts
1300 sqm, recently renovated. The home is distributed as follows: Entry hall that takes to an ample living room with access to the terrace and joined to the dining area and the

first floor, three complete bedrooms with 3 bathrooms. On the basement, parking place for
4-5 cars, 2 bedrooms apartments with bathrooms, kitchens, storage room, sauna and
