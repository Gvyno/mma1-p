Very charming bungalow in Mijas Golf. Typical andalusian style one plan villa with a beautiful garden. 
The villa has 3 bedrooms with one bathroom ensuite and 2 others bathrooms to share. You have a big livingroom and diningroom that lead you to the charming terrace and garden. The kitchen is also big with a diningtable. You could easely open it to the livingroom if you want. From the kitchen you also has a separate laundryroom. 
Below the house you have a huge basement that could be converted to an extra room/bedroom. 
The villa is gated and has an garage and space for more car infront of it. 
You have the possibility to build a pool on the plot as well. 
A great investment in a beautiful area close to beautiful town of Fuengirola and just 3mn from the famous Mijas Golf.
