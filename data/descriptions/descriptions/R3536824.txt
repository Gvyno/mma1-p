18,560m² of urban land ready for commercial development, located in a prestigious urbanisation in Coín and with quick access to the main roads to Marbella, Málaga, Fuengirola and Mijas. It is an idyllic place, surrounded by nature and ideal for golf lovers, only 20-30 minutes from the best beaches in Málaga and 30 minutes from the airport.

The plot has a proposed planning project with the following characteristics:

Hotel-Apartments: Small groups distributed around a leafy garden, with ponds and streams. The central building will have a reception, lounges, administration and restaurant-cafeteria. Next to this building is the pool, that in turn will be equipped with its own bar-club service.

The hotel will comprise: 26 double rooms with bathroom and kitchenette; 56 apartments with one bedroom, living room, kitchenette and a bathroom; and 28 apartments with two bedrooms, living room, kitchenette and bathroom. This means a minimum accommodation of 276 places, although 350 seats can be easily accommodated.

In the northern section, tourism will be enhanced with the inclusion of a bullring and a shopping centre. The whole area will be equipped with parking spaces both at ground level and underground.
