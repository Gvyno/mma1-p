Villa Lea is a contemporary villa with emphasis on comfort and privacy. Located within a secure gated community, its location is secure and convenient - merely 2 minutes from Nueva Andalucia, 10 minutes from San Pedro de Alcántara and Puerto Banus, and 15 minutes from the exclusive Puente Romano. Despite its proximity to a variety of restaurants and activities, Villa Lea offers the tranquility and seclusion of a private retreat.

Upon entry, you are greeted by a spacious, high-ceilinged open area that seamlessly connects two lounges—each equipped with an integrated TV and stove—to a dining room with kitchen access and a separate laundry room. The ground floor also features a double bedroom complete with a dressing room and an ensuite bathroom, alongside an additional bathroom for visitors. Each room on this level offers direct access to an expansive terrace that boasts panoramic views of both the sea and mountains, enhancing the sense of openness and integration with the natural surroundings.

The property&#039;s private garden is a highlight, featuring a large hot water pool that invites you to soak in the spectacular vistas. Ascending to the upper floor, you&#039;ll find three double bedrooms, all offering dressing rooms and ensuite bathrooms. The master bedroom, in particular, impresses with its generous dimensions and a private terrace that overlooks the sea, promising a serene and luxurious personal space.

The basement houses multiple storage rooms and an underground garage with ample space for two large vehicles, complemented by an additional carport at the property&#039;s entrance for guest parking. Beneath the pool lies an untapped area with potential for conversion into a fifth bedroom, cinema, or gym, offering further customization to meet the homeowner&#039;s lifestyle needs.
