A nice family house close to town, shops and school.
recently totally renovated with quality materials.
The house is in a quit dead end street, parking in front of the house on a private spot.
There is a very big storage room next to the house and a garden with different fruit trees.
You enter the house trough a well sized living room and in the back is the kitchen and there is also a bathroom with large shower on the ground floor.
The steps take you up to the 3 bedrooms and another bathroom.
