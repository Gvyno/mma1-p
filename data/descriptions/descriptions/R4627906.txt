As one of the most exclusive townhouse projects on the coast, these 33 south-facing homes offer "golden views" of the sea as far as Gibraltar and the Atlas Mountains of Morocco. Here you can enjoy plenty of space for your individual lifestyle and a lot of privacy. The location is ideal: surrounded by idyllic nature, you can reach the beach, shops and restaurants as well as the exclusive marina of Sotogrande in just a few minutes. The lively town of Estepona is about 15 minutes away.
