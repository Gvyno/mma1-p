This relatively large town house in the old town of Alhaurin el Grande needs a complete renovation, but is a property with a lot of potential.

On the ground floor there are currently 2 bedrooms, a kitchen, a bathroom, a living room and a patio.

The 1st floor can be reached via a staircase in the patio or through a separate door in the facade. The floor is currently still under construction and can be expanded according to wishes and ideas.

Since there is already a separate access to the 1st floor, the house can definitely be converted into 2 independent apartments.

The approximately 50m2 large roof terrace offers a wonderful view of the valley and the mountains
