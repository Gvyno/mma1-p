This wonderful family home offers great indoor and outdoor living space, and a great location. The property has 4 bedrooms and 3 bedrooms on the upper level, a very large living dining room, a fully fitted kitchen and a very large terrace on the middle floor, and at pool and garden level there is the added bonus of a guest apartment with bathroom, along with an outdoor kitchen and bar, a jacuzzi and a very stylish pergola providing covered seating. The pool area opens out to a flat garden and further down the plot are more garden and driveway areas which could be developed. The house was built to a very high standard, a great buy!
