We are delighted to present this studio on the Paseo Marítimo with spectacular and unobstructed views. Unbeatable area of Fuengirola, in the port and close to all kinds of facilities. The beach is less than 5 minutes walk. It is also perfectly connected to other cities and the airport through the bus station and the train station. Both barely 5 minutes walk from this studio.
