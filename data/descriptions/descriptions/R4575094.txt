The basement houses a bodega and an indoor heated pool with relaxation space and a bar. Expansive terraces and gardens provide access to a large outdoor swimming pool, creating an ideal setting for entertaining.

The property is equipped with a state-of-the-art domotics system, and sophisticated lighting enhances its allure. Italian marble flooring graces the interiors, with wooden flooring adding warmth to the bedrooms. This contemporary masterpiece not only fulfills the desires of those seeking a modern home but also secures a prime location that is typically elusive in the realm of luxury real estate.
