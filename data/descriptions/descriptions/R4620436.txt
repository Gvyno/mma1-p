Plot 708 with project in La Mairena.

The location is exceptional, situated in a secure environment and surrounded by breathtaking mountains that extend down to the sea. You are guaranteed to enjoy the finest views on the Costa del Sol. Opting to construct your own luxurious villa in La Mairena, just a short distance from beautiful sandy beaches, a variety of excellent restaurants, shops, and a golf course, means selecting the most sought-after location by our international investors. Given the high demand for these plots of land, we are fortunate to have only a limited number remaining, along with the advantage of full building permits. Once you decide on the villa type you prefer, construction can commence immediately.
