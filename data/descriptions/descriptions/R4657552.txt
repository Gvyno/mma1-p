Beautiful spacious and bright 3-bedroom apartment with panoramic sea views in the upper part of Calahonda. This originally 2-bedroom apartment has been converted into a 3-bedroom apartment. Part of the large original living room has been closed off to create a third bedroom. The 3 bedrooms are spacious, with built-in wardrobes and natural light. The master en suite has direct access to the main terrace and the second bedroom has its own terrace at the back of the apartment. The southeast-facing terrace has been glazed and the current owner uses it as a living-dining room where you can enjoy the sun and the view. The kitchen is separate and fully equipped. There is an air conditioning unit installed in the living area and pre-installation in the rest of the property. This is a great property for a family. Access from the communal parking is easy and without steps. The urbanization offers 2 swimming pools and a children's play area.
It is only a 5-minute drive to reach all the services you can find in Calahonda and the beach, and a 15-minute drive to Fuengirola or Marbella.
