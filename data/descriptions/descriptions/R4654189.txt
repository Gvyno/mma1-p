Stunning 2-bedroom townhouse in the heart of Estepona, fully renovated to include stunning architectural features!!
 The ground floor is open plan with distinctive dining and cosy living room areas, and it incorporates a superb kitchen with top of the range appliances and breakfast bar. There is also a guest toilet. The clever internal patio, fully enclosed in glass, brings natural light onto the space, and adds tons of character and style with a full wall of natural stone.
Upstairs, both charming double bedrooms have wooden beams and natural light and share the bathroom equipped with a shower enclosure. Finally, upstairs, the massive terrace has plenty of space for sunbathing, relaxing and entertaining with a fantastic Weber barbecue, dining set and loungers ready to go.
The renovation included rewiring and replumbing so there is really nothing to do.
Location is ideal. 1 min walk to the townhall and 3 minutes' walk to the new pedestrianised promenade and the beach.
This property is a "one-of-a-kind" gem in the old town. A fantastic investment ready to be enjoyed and loved. It also has a tourist licence and a proven record of short let's carried out last year. Contact us to arrange your viewing before it is too late!
