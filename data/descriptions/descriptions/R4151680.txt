The most interesting property, with the most potential, at the best value for money I have seen this year. 5 Bedroom villa, all bright and spacious. Very large lounge dinning room with open fire place, opens out onto a covered terrace and private pool with spectacular southern panoramic views of the cost. The property also has a sauna steam room and an enclosed bathhouse for peace and calm. The property has its own well that goes through a filtration system and plenty of solar panels for those who like the idea of off grid living. The property is hooked up to the grid also. 
The area is being massively invested in with new roads foot paths etc, so I believe this to be a fantastic property for investment. Really is a must see
