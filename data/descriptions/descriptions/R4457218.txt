It's part of a small group of just seven apartments known as "EL PARADOR," and it's the only one with a private plunge pool, adding an extra touch of exclusivity.
This private retreat is surrounded by lush golf courses, green forests, and majestic mountains, all just a short drive from Marbella. It's a natural gem nestled in peaceful surroundings.
Access to this exclusive complex is through a private Andalusian-style courtyard that complements the local aesthetics and sets the tone for what you'll find inside.
It's worth noting that "EL PARADOR" is the only group of apartments in the entire La Zagaleta urbanization, making it a truly unique find.
In 2021, this apartment underwent a complete renovation, adopting a rustic design that harmonizes well with the natural environment and the complex itself.
