Spacious ground floor apartment with 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms and a private garden and terrace. Located within a small and exclusive gated complex of only twelve apartments, so there are few neighbors and it is quiet all year round. 

The development is located in the upper part of La Duquesa, just a 20-minute walk to the Marina and the beach, close to all amenities and next to La Duquesa golf course. The community has landscaped gardens with sunbathing areas, swimming pool and wonderful views of the Mediterranean Sea.

The apartment, aside from the underground private parking space, has a very convenient outdoor parking area directly in front of the main entrance, through which we enter via the front door. 

Upon entering the apartment, we find on the left-hand side an excellent sized kitchen with access to a separate laundry terrace. Directly in front of the entrance hallway, we reach the living room, from which you access the private covered terrace.

To the right of the entrance hallway we find ensuite bedrooms, each with a different access. The master bedroom overlooks the private garden.

This apartment represents a wonderful investment opportunity to acquire a second holiday home or to become your main residence just minutes away from the golf, the beach, the port and everything you need.
