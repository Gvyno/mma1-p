Discover The Resina 6ix Development, in La Resina Golf on the New Golden Mile. This exclusive project features six modern, newly built villas, each perched on an elevated plot for optimal views and privacy.

Villa 5, one of these exquisite homes, spans three floors and boasts five bedrooms. Upon entering, you&#039;re greeted by a versatile living area that doubles as a welcoming space. The master bedroom, to the left, overlooks the sea and features a bright en-suite bathroom and a spacious walk-in closet. The choice of fabrics and materials throughout the villa adds a layer of warmth and luxury to its modern design. To the right, a second en-suite bedroom is situated.

A feature staircase, adorned with a chandelier as a central art piece, leads down to the heart of the home. Here, a main living area merges with a kitchen equipped with Siemens appliances and a dining space accented by a stylish wall for wine display. This level opens out to a vast terrace with an infinity pool, barbecue, and lounge area, alongside three additional bedrooms.

Villa 5 doesn&#039;t stop there; it boasts a rooftop terrace with pre-installations for a jacuzzi and BBQ, offering a perfect retreat for relaxation and entertainment. Additionally, a raw basement presents a blank canvas for the new owner to customise their dream space.

Sustainability meets luxury in this villa, equipped with solar panels installed by SolarMind. These panels are not just energy-efficient but also environmentally conscious, making Villa 5 an exemplary choice for those who value sustainability without compromising on luxury.
