Second beach line 4-bedroom townhouse in Sabinillas center. 
The property is currently divided into 2 completely independent apartments, an ideal investment idea. But can be turned into a regular 2-level townhouse to live in easily!
On the ground floor we find the living space with an open style kitchen, 2 bedrooms and a bathroom with shower.
On the first floor we have another living area, independent kitchen, bathroom with bathtub and 2 bedrooms.
And on the upper floor there is a big utility room and the roof terrace with sea views.
The house is sold furnished and enjoys hot/cold Ac system.
Amazing opportunity to get a house at the town center and only meters away from the beach and the great promenade ideal for lovely morning walks and with the advantage of being located withing walking distance to all amenities: restaurants, schools, supermarkets, taxis, etc.
