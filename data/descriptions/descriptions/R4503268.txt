A FERRARI ON THE OUTSIDE, A ROLLS ROYCE ON THE INSIDE

Well, how do you describe a masterpiece like this one with words? It is virtually impossible, but note the following:
You will not find a house, as well built as this one – This large villa is built according to Scandinavian standards and that includes anything from drainage to insulation. In addition you have a large garage (for 5-6 cars) and even a part of the basement that can be turned into a separate apartment or a bodega with its own entrance. 
The pictures will speak for themselves, but the views from this gem of gems are breathtaking! Panoramic to say the least where you can see all the way to Cabopino on your left, the northern Coast of Africa straight a head and the whole rock of Gibraltar slightly to your right. Impressive to say the least! No pictures in the world will do this property justice. It needs to be seen first hand and on site, so please do not hesitate to contact us for a viewing where we will share all the other goodies this house offers, with you.
