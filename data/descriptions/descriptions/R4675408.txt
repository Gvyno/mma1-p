This is a lovely large house comprising 3 bedrooms, 2.5 bathrooms, private pool, front line golf and open sea views, plus it is only a 5 minutes walk to the Marina of La Duquesa.
Spread over two floors this home is spacious and bright. On entering the house you are immediately greeted by the most amazing panoramic golf and sea views. The sitting room, with feature fireplace, is large with a fantastic terrace overlooking the golf course and has stairs taking you down to the pool and BBQ area. Upstairs, the modern kitchen is extremely large and was totally refurbished a few years ago.  There is enough space for a large table in the kitchen, plenty of workspace and cupboards and, again, beautiful sea views.
The three bedrooms are downstairs. The master bedroom is extremely large with a shower room and bathtub and has direct access to the pool area. Bedrooms two and three share a full bathroom. 
The house is south facing so enjoys sun throughout the day. There is a private garage with direct access to the kitchen and there is also parking directly outside. 
This property is large enough for permanent living and would also make a fantastic holiday home or rental investment due to its location, size and views.
