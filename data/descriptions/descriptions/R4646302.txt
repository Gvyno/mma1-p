One of the most sought-after locations on the western side of Marbella, San Pedro de Alcantara has proven to be a very desirable location for those looking to live full time in the Costa del Sol, or to be fortunate enough to own a holiday home in this fabulous location.
This San Pedro townhouse is exceptional for a number of reasons. 
It is currently being reformed to a wonderful contemporary style, with open plan kitchen and living area, opening onto a large south-west facing terrace and private garden.
The property in Marbella West is being finished with 4 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms, but most impressive of all is the superb and large basement area. It is being reformed with preinstallations for whatever use the new owners may wish to put it to, and with natural light feeding in from the English patio from the south-facing garden outside.
An opportunity for a large family home on the side of the beach in Marbella.
