Do you like cruises? Let me seduce you with the charm of living aboard a similar experience every day. I am a home with a special secret: part of my spacious terrace has been elegantly transformed into a second bedroom, offering a private retreat where the sunrise gently enters every morning.
 Imagine having that feeling of freedom and endless views every day. I am that home that offers you the thrill of a perpetual journey, with an uncovered terrace that is your own private command bridge. In winter, when the rain decorates the city, you can watch the scene from my cosy covered terrace, feeling the magic without getting wet.

With an east, south and southwest orientation, I'm designed to bathe in light and warmth from dawn to dusk. Imagine your parties with friends, barbecues that stretch into the evening, and those nights dancing under a starry sky to the music of Supertramp.

I am more than a structure; I am the memory maker, the space where you can enjoy and share unforgettable moments with your loved ones. I present myself to you not just as a home, but as the setting for your next adventure.

If my proposal resonates with you and you are ready to embark on this unique experience, connect with us. It will be the first step towards the life you are ready to begin.

I look forward to being the next chapter in your story,
Your future home with a cruising view.
