A gorgeous plot, brimming with business opportunity. 

This plot in Coín with a large ruin has a great abundance of fruit trees. 

With multiple sources of water including 3 wells and irrigation water, there is a huge opportunity here for agricultural business.

Coín is the central town of the Guadalhorce valley. It is the place to be for locals and farmers living in the surrounding villages, as Coín offers a wide range of shops (Mercadona, Dia, Aldi, Lidl), garages, agricultural stores and fruterias (local fruit and vegetable stores). 

Not only agriculture is very present in Coín, the typical Andalusian lifestyle is also an important aspect of daily life in the village. The authentic town centre is very pretty and next to the many local tapas bars and restaurants, there are tons of outdoor activities you can enjoy including hiking, cycling, horse riding. 

Coín is only a 20 minute (35 km) drive from Málaga and the airport. The beaches of the Costa del Sol are just a 30 minute (26 km) drive away.
