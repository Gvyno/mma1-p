INDEPENDENT VILLA IN THE CENTRE OF MARBELLA, EXCELLENT HIGH RETURN INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY.

The property is located in the centre of Marbella, on Av Jose María Gironella, Huerta Belón.

It is an independent building of 821 sqm on a plot of 1,110 sqm.  Built on 1975, the property principal use at present is commercial, in fact it has been the offices of an important multinational security company for the last 30 years. Most important is that both residential and "dotacional" (for sport, health, religious, social activities) uses are compatible, allowed there.

The property needs a deep refurbishment and adaptation to the new use, we estimate a capital expenditure close to 1 million.  In our opinion it would be a high ROI investment if it was transformed into a student residence or temporary-mid term rentals, there is a very high local demand and prices have rocketed.  There are more options in any case, the plot can be divided in two, and two villas could be built there.
