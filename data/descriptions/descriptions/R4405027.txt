Fantastic family mews house in the heart of El Paraiso, walking distance to all amenities

This superb house is larger than other three bedroom townhouses on the complex and enjoys a very privileged position looking down over the gardens. It's beautifully presented and well maintained so perfect if you're looking for somewhere to move into straight away. 

Enter through the front door into a lovely open living / dining room with working fireplace and plenty of room to enjoy a quiet night in. There is also ample space to relax on the ground floor terrace overlooking the communal gardens to the front of the property, or entertain dinner guests on the internal patio. The kitchen is a good size with plenty of cupboard space and work surfaces. 

Also on this level is a very large master bedroom with generously proportioned ensuite bathroom (with window for natural light and ventilation). 

Upstairs the two guest bedrooms share a family bathroom. The larger of the two bedrooms has access to a wide, sunny terrace (recently resurfaced) with views across the gardens (and offering a glimpse of the Mediterranean). The third bedroom has a smaller juliet balcony. 

Air conditioning has been installed in the main rooms for a more comfortable stay.

The complex is in the early stages of adding a pool to the community gardens. Plan included with pictures. This will be sited in the lower garden area, just a minute or two walk from the property. 

With options for parking right outside the door, this home from home is ideal for multi generational holidays as it's very easy to access all the amenities in Benavista by foot, as well as the beach (via footbridge), supermarkets and sports facilities.
