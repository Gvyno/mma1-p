Lovely Andalucian style villa on a huge flat plot located in El Paraiso Medio and within walking distance to a wide range of restaurants and shops. The beach is merely a 10-15 minutes walk as is the golf club of El Paraiso. Splendid location, close to everything yet providing total privacy on its expansive flat plot.  Views are to the garden with some partial sea views.
This family home is built over one level, it was originally built in the 1970's however completely refurbished in 2015 with new floors, carpentry, electricity and plumbing. The distribution of the rooms are all mostly south facing with large window or french doors leading to the terraces, providing outdoor/indoor living to take full advange of the Spanish lifestyle. The kitchen is particularly large and includes an inviting dining area. The spacious master bedroom is entered through a large dressing room and also has a huge en-suite bathroom. There are further two guest bedrooms with en-suite bathrooms in this wing of the house. The fourth bedroom has a separate entrance and thus functions well as a guest or staff bedroom. Features include air conditioning, underfloor heating in the bathrooms and kitchen, a fireplace in the living room and radiators for heating in the winter months.
There is one garage incorprated into the house, and additional space for parking 2-3 cars inside the property. The gardens are extensive with many fruit trees, a big swimming pool and a recent added pool house with BBQ and seating areas for summer entertaining. 
Perfect family home as it is  - which also has potential for investors given its huge plot!
