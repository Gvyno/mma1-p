One bedroom townhouse in beautiful beachfront complex of Villacana on Estepona's New Golden Mile. 

You can't help but be captivated by Villacana's tranquil and calm atmosphere. Designed to emulate a traditional Spanish pueblo, the small pedestrian pathways are overflowing with gorgeous bougainvillea and other fragrant plants. The beach and it's coastal pathway are less than five minutes walk away from the front door but the complex also offers four swimming pools, restaurants, hairdressers, rental agents, supermarket, tennis courts and even stables for those looking to enjoy some horse riding on the beach. There are large supermarkets nearby and the towns of Estepona or San Pedro are within easy reach by car or bus. 

Accessed via the network of small pedestrian pathways, this one bedroom townhouse is wonderfully private and homely. Its walled patio and wood framed windows and shutters add to the Andalucian flavour and complement the local architectural style. Inside and on the ground floor you will find an L-shaped living room and kitchen as well as a handy downstairs cloakroom. Upstairs the bright and sunny master bedroom is really delightful and offers its own large ensuite bathroom. 

This is an ideal property for those looking to generate an income from holiday rentals although it would also be a lovely home for a couple looking to spend longer holidays there or live permanently.
