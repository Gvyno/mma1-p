Introducing the newest off-plan villa project, a stunning Scandinavian-style residence that embodies modern luxury and comfort. This exquisite 5-bedroom, 4-bathroom villa is set to be key-ready in 2025, offering a perfect blend of contemporary design and functionality.

As you step into the property on the ground floor, you are welcomed by a luminous living room seamlessly connected to an open-plan kitchen and dining area capable of accommodating up to 10 people. The ground floor also features the first bedroom and a bathroom. Flowing towards the terrace, you&#039;ll discover a lounge area and an outdoor dining space, complemented by a swimming pool on the same level, creating an ideal layout for the seamless transition between indoor and outdoor living. An uncovered terrace with sun-beds provides an additional space for relaxation.

Moving upstairs to the first floor, on your right, you&#039;ll find the second and third bedrooms sharing a bathroom, while the master ensuite bedroom with a walk-in closet occupies a privileged position. Both the third bedroom and the master bedroom open up to a covered terrace. This level offers access to the property from another side and provides an additional parking space for your convenience.

Ascend the stairs to reach the solarium, a delightful space offering panoramic views and an opportunity to bask in the sunlight. Perfect for outdoor dining with a built-in kitchen and bar area, it&#039;s an ideal spot to enjoy spectacular sunsets.

The villa&#039;s basement is a haven of well-being, featuring a gym, fifth bedroom that could be also used as storage room, bathroom and a spa area with jacuzzi, steam, and sauna rooms. Parking is ample, with space for two cars, a garage for one car, and an uncovered parking space.

This off-plan villa is not just a home; it&#039;s a statement of refined living, where thoughtful design meets unparalleled amenities, creating a residence that exceeds expectations. Secure your place in this visionary project, where every detail has been meticulously crafted to offer you the epitome of modern living.
