Location, Location, Location. Great opportunity to buy a 3 bedroom semi detached bungalow located in the lower part of El Chaparral. This is the end of a row corner house. This house is only a stones throw to the beach as only a short walk to the underpass which brings you to Wassa Beach. This is a small complex of only 19 houses shaped in a U,  all have their own individual private gardens which lead out to the Communal Garden and pool area in this gated complex.

Enter the house into the hall and on the right you have the fully fitted kitchen on the left leads to the 3 double  bedrooms , and two bathrooms, and straight ahead into the large bright sitting/dining room with fireplace. The feature in the sitting room is the ceiling which high and slanted with nice wooden beams. This leads out to the private garden.  As it is a corner house you can walk around to the side entrance at the front of the house  which is handy if you are coming up from the beach and want to go to your garden or pool area. This area also has a private store area, so ideal to keep your surf boards when you come up from the beach.

The location is of course perfect, less then 5 mins to La Cala de Mijas so within walking distance, close to sea , there is also an 18 hole Golf  Course in  the urbanisation of  El Chaparral, close to public transport, and easy access to the A7.  Only 10 mins from Fuengirola and 20 mins to Marbella. The board walk from Calahonda to La Cala will soon reach El Chaparral.

This charming Andalucian rustic style cottage is ideal to live in all year round or use as a holyiday home, perfect for remote working and also has great rental potential.
