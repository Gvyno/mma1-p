A chance to acquire what must be one of the most desirable properties in the La Cala area. This lovely family house in lower El Chaparral truly has so much to offer already but with so much potential to put your own design on it.  On the upper floor you have a large lounge with plenty of windows giving lots of natural light and access to the terrace with partial sea views.  There is a separate dining room plus a very generous fully fitted kitchen, 2 huge double bedrooms and 2 bathrooms.  Downstairs has an additional lounge kitchen diner, double bedroom and an en-suite bathroom so it can easily be used as a separate apartment or it can be re-arranged to make extra bedrooms for example.  Outside you have a private swimming pool, wooden decked terrace with bar area and plenty of garden space with lots of possibilities.  Other features include a private garage plus plenty of storage space
