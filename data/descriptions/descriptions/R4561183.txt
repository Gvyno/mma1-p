Lovely 2 bed/ 2 bath apartment on the first floor, no lift . Due to its South-South East orientation you can enjoy the sun from dusk till dawn. Two big terraces offer a lot of outdoor space for entertaining or sunbathing. Lovely views to the sea and overlooking the treetops of the surrounding pine trees give that special Mediterranean holiday feeling. Being a corner unit, each room has a window, what guarantees loads of natural light and good air circulation. 

Superbly located, this mature and established community in Calahonda is a genuine easy walk within a few minutes to absolutely everything you could possibly need. With a multitude of bars and restaurants, two supermarkets and not forgetting the beach itself, you won''t be able to find anything comparable in terms of location.

The apartment is furnished and has a fully equipped kitchen. Centralized air-condition hot and cold. 

Please be aware that some of the photos showing a reformed and modern apartment are of the show flat (apartment 47), a wonderful representation of what these apartments can become. 

Enjoy the two community pools and garden area, as well as community parking for owners, without specific space assignment.
