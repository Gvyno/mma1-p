New construction!!!
Ground floor of 50m2 consists of two bedrooms, a bathroom, living-dining room and fitted kitchen. The property has a swimming pool and shared garage. All sales are exterior except the bathroom
Excellent location, near the beach and the center of Fuengirola, just a five-minute walk away.
Being a ground floor and being at street level, it is ideal for people with reduced mobility. There is a community terrace for use and enjoyment, recently closed.
In the plans we can see the distribution of the property, the bathroom has been changed and it has finally been put online.
