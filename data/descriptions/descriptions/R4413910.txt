Partially renovated luxury villa by the beach, nestled in a prime location just 200 meters away from the San Pedro de Alcántara beach promenade. This exceptional property spans across two levels, complemented by an expansive basement of nearly 200 sq. meters, presenting an exciting canvas for conversion into a cinema room, gym, spa, or any desired space.

The main level unveils a spacious living room, a fully equipped open-plan kitchen, a dining area, and four bedrooms, including two en-suite. Flowing from here is access to a covered porch featuring a dining table, seamlessly connecting to the garden and pool area. The outdoor space boasts a serene chill-out zone and a sun-drenched deck, perfect for basking in the sun.

Upstairs, two en-suite bedrooms await, accompanied by a generously sized family room or lounge area. This upper floor opens to another expansive private terrace, adding a touch of exclusivity.

A rare chance to own a beachside villa in the coveted Cortijo Blanco area of San Pedro de Alcántara, offering not only proximity to the beach and charming beach bars but also the vibrant nightlife and upscale boutiques of Puerto Banus. Esteemed international schools and the amenities of San Pedro's downtown are conveniently located nearby.
