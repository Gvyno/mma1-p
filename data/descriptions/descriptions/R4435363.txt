Los Arqueros Golf & Country Club is a prestigious golf club located in the municipality of Benahavís, near Marbella, in the province of Malaga, Spain. The club was designed by the legendary Spanish golfer Severiano Ballesteros and opened its doors in 1991. It is known for its beautiful setting in the Sierra de Ronda foothills, offering panoramic views of the Mediterranean Sea and the surrounding mountains.

The history of Los Arqueros Golf & Country Club dates back to the late 1980s when Ballesteros, who had achieved great success as a professional golfer, embarked on a career in golf course design. He collaborated with Spanish architect Antonio García Garrido to create a challenging and picturesque golf course in the Costa del Sol region.

The construction of Los Arqueros Golf & Country Club began in 1989, and it was officially inaugurated in 1991. The course covers an area of approximately 60 hectares and features 18 holes spread across a hilly landscape with numerous natural obstacles such as ravines, streams, and lakes. Ballesteros' design aimed to incorporate the natural features of the land while creating a demanding yet enjoyable golfing experience for players of all levels.
