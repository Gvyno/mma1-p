Exclusive listing! Exquisite Detached Villa in one of the most established and tranquil locations of the Costa del Sol, Guadalmina Baja / Casasola.

Situated just a few minutes walk to the beach, this location is absolutely perfect for your family home in the sunny Costa del Sol. This immaculate villa has been transformed by the current owners and no expense have been spared. This wonderful property has 5 bedrooms and 5.5 bathrooms. During the renovations all of the windows in the villa, including the bedrooms  were replaced with floor to ceiling double doors giving all the rooms that feeling of space and light. The kitchen has all top of the range appliances and has been opened to flow perfectly into the dining and living area.

The basement has been completely reformed to include your own private cinema room.

The garage is very large and has room for 3 cars.

The very generous garden, of course with your own private swimming heated pool, has been kept, just like the house, absolutely immaculately.
