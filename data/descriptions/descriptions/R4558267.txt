"We present this wonderful villa just 2 minutes by car from La Cubana beach. Located in a very quiet area. The villa is on the corner, is very bright and has impressive views of the sea.

It currently has 3 bedrooms and one more in the guest house. In total there are 4. It has two full bathrooms although there is the possibility of taking out another one.

Fully equipped independent kitchen and very good sized living room with fireplace.

The exterior of the house is large in size, with different areas such as the porch that is accessed from the living room and has wonderful views of the sea or also the garden with pool. The house is wonderful to enjoy, as well as great as an investment opportunity."
