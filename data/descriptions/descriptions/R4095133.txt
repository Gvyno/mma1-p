If you have a dream of owning a grand luxury apartment over looking a wide sandy beach completely free of traffic, then this is the place for you. Originally planned as two large seafront apartments each of three bedrooms the property has been cleverly re-distributed to provide a grand salon with dining with the four bedrooms, three bathrooms and kitchen all distributing off this focal area. The wrap around 80m2 terrace provides plenty of space for shared activities or quiet contemplation. Rest peacefully to the gentle lullaby of the sea and bask in the contentment this unique property provides.
