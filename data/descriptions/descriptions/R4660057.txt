La Cornisa in Calahonda, a very popular and well looked after complex.

Here we have a 3 bedroom Town House with a studio apartment. 

Enter the house going down a few steps from the street level and you are into the sitting/dining room which has a nice pellet burning fireplace , to the right of the entrance you have  the kitchen  and  utility room and  on the left a guest toilet.  From the sitting room you can walk out to  a nice terrace with panoramic views of Calahonda and down to the Coast.  From here you can go up to an upper small solarium again with even better views.  There are some solar panels placed here.

Back to the sitting room  and here you have access to the stairs which goes down to the bedrooms, one of the bedrooms is ensuite the design of this room is nice and quirky, to the right you have another double bedroom and this leads out to an enclosed terrace which can be used for a children's bedroom.  From here you have access down to the studio apartment below, however, you also have access to the studio via a path and exit to the outside road so it can be totally independent. On this level you also have another bathroom.  The studio apartment is large and open plan with a fully fitted kitchen and bathroom.

La Cornisa is well renowned as a very well kept community and has two lovely pool areas.

This house is ideal to live in all year round or use as a holiday home with great rental potential.
