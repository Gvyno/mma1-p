REDUCED TO SELL!!!!
A fantastic opportunity to purchase a recently refurbished and renovated 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom apartment just a few minutes walk from the beach. Ideally situated not only for the beach but also for a large supermarket, bars and restaurants and also public transport. The A7 is close by but cannot be seen or heard when you are at home or outside, so it does make commuting very easy. 

The apartment is light and spacious with plenty of storage. Make the most of the well kept community gardens and pool or stroll to the beach at your leisure. The bustling town of San Pedro is less than 5 minutes away and Puerto Banus is under 10 minutes (by car) 

The community fees include water. Please note that the community does not allow short term rentals although long term rentals are permitted.

The apartment is on the first floor however please note there is no lift. It is sold fully furnished and everything is in excellent condition. The views are of the garden and pool.
