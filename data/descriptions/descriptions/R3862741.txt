Donald Gray is a legend of the architecture of the Costa del Sol, without being an architect, with a deep love of crafts, the ideologist of the best recovery of Andalusian architecture. His signature appears in urbanizations such as La Virginia and Las Lomas in Marbella or San Nicolás in Granada. They are constructions that are not ashamed of a deep respect for history and tradition.
