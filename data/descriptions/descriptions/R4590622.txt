After long market research, years of seeking inspiration and hard planning, our concept came to life, offering something new in Marbella. With our long local market knowledge and expertise in construction, arquitecture, real estate and hospitality we put Boutique hotel Aisthesis to life. 
With inspiration from true Mediterranean living, Mykonian influences and local Andalucian heritage, we shaped the concept. The name is inspired by the human senses, touch, sight, hearing, smell and toste, which all together sums up the full experience of a stay here. 
This project is a completely developed hotel concept ready in place with a high ROi calculated. 
The project is offered for sale with several business opportunities such as running the business with full management resources provided or to invest and sell. The concept can be adapted after any request, changes in design or services. The existing business operating in the building is an art gallery. 
The project is subject to any modification that any client may need, such a number of rooms, style or the use of the spaces.
