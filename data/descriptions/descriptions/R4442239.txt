One million euro views that kind of sums up this property that really needs to be seen to be appreciated properly. This attractive elevated property is located in the frontline beach and Port complex in Cabopino. The property is really a one bedroom property but also has an extra room/area on the upper level being used as a second bedroom and it could easily be converted into a second bedroom. The property has a nice terrace with amazing views over the port, sea and the beach.  The complex has two swimming pools.
