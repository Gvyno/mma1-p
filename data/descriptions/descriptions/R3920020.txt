A large detached villa in the popular El Faro de Calaburras urbanization in Mijas Costa located just a 600 meter walk to the beach.

The house has been owned and lovingly maintained by the current owners for the last 20 years and is presented in excellent condition.

The property consists of, on the entrance level, a large lounge diner with marble fireplace and aspect windows, independent fully fitted kitchen, two double bedrooms and a bathroom with walk-in shower. Also on this level is a delightful sunny terrace overlooking the mature lawned garden.

Moving downstairs we find an enormous master bedroom with ensuite bathroom complete with jacuzzi bathtub and walk-in shower as well as another double bedroom and access outside to the garden.

The house is south west facing and sits on a plot of over 600m2 complete with lots of both covered and uncovered terrace space giving you the option of sun or shade at all time of the day. For the sun-worshippers among you there is also a rooftop terrace where you can sunbathe to your heart's content.

The garden offers plenty of room to install a swimming pool but there's no real need as the house enjoys access to the El Faro de Calaburras communal pool just down the road.

Additional features included double glazing, hot and cold air-conditioning, high speed internet connection, utility room, lots of storage and a private garage.
