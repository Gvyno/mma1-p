A large gated estate with private road consisting of 5 villas for renovation on substantial plots with private pools and sea views from the upper levels. The existing villas are in various states of repair and offer private pools and sea views. There are two modern 4/5 bed villas requiring only minor renovation - built to a high standard in 2000 (hardly lived in) with high quality cream marble flooring and gas central heating; a third 4 bed contemporary style villa with indoor pool that requires only minor renovation; and a very large original 7 bed villa on an 8000 m2 plot with grand outdoor swimming pool and a huge indoor pool with spa that requires total reform and a 4 bed guest villa also in need of total renovation. This is an ideal project for a developer or investor.
