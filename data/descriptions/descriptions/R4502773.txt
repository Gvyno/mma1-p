This stunning apartment has the best of both worls: it is located in the very historic centre of Malaga, in a beautiful, representative building which was a proper city palace 100 years ago built by the Larios family, and yet it is totally new because the building was entirely gutted and reformed. And so while we can enjoy the amazing central setting and features characteristic of city palaces, it is fitted with fibre optic, double glazing and all modern technology as well as an underground parking (! ) at the same time.

The ceilings are very high and so there is a lot of light coming through the tall windows adorned by classical mediterranean shutters and pretty little French balconies.

The interior design has been profesionally done and utilizes perfectly the space as well as reflecing modern trends.

It is walkng distance to hundreds of bars, restaurants, shops. Literally all of the beautiful old town of Malaga is at the door step.

It is 6 minutes walking to the Cathedral, 12 minutes to the new metro station Atarazanas, and 18 minutes to the beach of Malagueta.

For city lovers and investors it's a dream come true!
