Totally refurbished 2 bedroom townhouse in "Monte Biarritz", Benahavis.

The property is distributed over two floors:

On accessing the property we have a patio of about 50m2 with "chill out" area and a small storage room, inside the property, on this same floor, we have a spacious living-dining room, open plan kitchen fully equipped with high end appliances and a complete bathroom.

Upstairs there are 2 bedrooms and 1 complete bathroom with bathtub. During the renovation, a balcony was removed to create a dressing room in the master bedroom.
