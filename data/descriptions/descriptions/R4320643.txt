Beautiful rustic house very close to the town of Estepona, only 15 min. The plot has a huge area of ​​cultivated land with fruit trees and bird views with exceptional privacy. Very well cared for and completely renovated with a country house where you can enjoy its fireplace in winter and a warm atmosphere for winter. The exterior part has its own pool, a very pleasant porch.
Completely renovated and very optimal condition. A real cutie to enjoy country life.
