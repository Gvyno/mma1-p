Fantastic 2-bedroom apartment just a few years old in the historic center. Mine neighborhood. Just 5 minutes walk from the famous Tajo de Ronda and "La Bola" street. It is in fabulous condition. With an interior patio that allows a lot of light to enter. Both bedrooms with built-in wardrobes, wooden floors. On the 2nd floor. Large garage space included, also a spacious storage room completely free of moisture. Very interesting property both to live in the center and as an investment for vacation rental due to its fantastic location
