Nice finca with 2 floors and small piece of land of 195m2 next to the property for sale only 5 minutes from the centre of Alhaurin el Grande. There is a bus stop at the top of the tarmac road, and the property is only a minute away from here, there is also a nice restaurant/ venta nearby. There is space for 2 cars at the front porch of the property and roadside parking. The property was built before 1993, renovated more than 10 years ago, so it does need some modernization. The plot would be perfect to place a fibre pool and chill out areas or plant some trees and veggie patch. 

As you enter the property you have to the left a fully fitted kitchen with a pantry. To the right of the hallway a living room and a seperate dining room (which can be knocked into one room) here is access to the 2nd level with a solarium terrace, there is currently no railings but easy to build. Back downstairs you have 2 spacious bedrooms and a large family bathroom. You have a back patio over looking the valley, campo and mountains and a laundry area / storage room, you could put a door here and steps down to the land. 

You have neighbours and a community septic tank. A nice finca at a great price and location. A video is available on request.
