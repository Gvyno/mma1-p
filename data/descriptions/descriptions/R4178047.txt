The views from this townhouse are really just fabulous, the outlook is panoramic looking towards Gibraltar & Morocco with amazing mountain views - set within a small urbanisation of 18 properties, maintained &  managed to a high standard.  The property is on 4 levels with the front of the house facing west. 

There are 3 bedrooms and 2.5 bathrooms.  On the entry level there is a W.C/ Cloakroom, a fully fitted kitchen with separate utility room, a spacious lounge with double glass fronted patio sliding doors leading on to one of the terraces.  The lounge has the benefit of an open fireplace that takes the very seldom chill out of the air in the winter!

Another staircase leads up to the middle level where there are 3 bright spacious bedrooms and 2 bathrooms one being the en-suite to the master bedroom.  All bedrooms have adequate wardrobe storage space and are all very bright.

Stairs then lead to the top level of the house where there are front and back sun terraces where you can relax and watch the sun rising or of course the sun setting whilst admiring the spectacular views. 

The basement of the house is vast which can house two cars in the garage and there is a very large store room 

Perfect house for all year living or as a holiday home.  Growing family or investors. 

The community is quiet and small.  Only half of the houses are occupied all year round and the pool often feels like a private pool, since it's used so infrequently!  

 The property has pre-installation for air-conditioning to be fitted.
