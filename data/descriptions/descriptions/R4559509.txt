A huge 3 bed 2 bath top floor apartment (just a small atico above) South to South West facing with amazing sea views and views to Gibraltar and Africa. The apartment has been fully reformed throughout and is ready for new owners to furnish it fully to their own taste. The beach is just 50 metres away and there are many cafes, restaurants and shops within a few minutes walk. The charming port of Duquesa is just a 12 minute walk along the seafront. I have a walkthrough video. For more information contact me anytime on the number supplied!
