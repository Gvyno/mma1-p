Fantastic commercial premises in the centre of Marbella. The premises, located in the central Street Nuestra Señora de Gracia, is currently in an unfinished state, and due to its surface and location, in a very commercial area and close to the promenade and the marina, it is ideal for a restaurant, clinic, office etc. It has a smoke vent and a wide façade. It has a height of 4 meters, which gives the option to make a mezzanine.
An ideal investment in the centre of Marbella. Do not hesitate to visit it
