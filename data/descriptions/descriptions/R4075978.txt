Country house located on the outskirts of Alhaurin el Grande, just 5 minutes from the town and from a golf course. The house is located on a 3076m2 plot planted entirely with avocados that are maintained with water from their own well. The plot is fully fenced, has a private pool, outdoor terrace and barbecue area. The house is on one level with a large covered porch of 27.50m2 at the entrance. Large entrance hall, fully furnished kitchen and spacious living room with fireplace as well as air conditioning. Master bedroom with en-suite bathroom with a Jacuzzi bath and two other double bedrooms with a second bathroom with shower. In the lower part we have a basement of 149m2, the same surface of the house where you can make an independent apartment or simply use it as a closed garage. The property is located in a strategic location a few minutes from the Sierra de Alhaurin and at the same time not far from all the facilities.
