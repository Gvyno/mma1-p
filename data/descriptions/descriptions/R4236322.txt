Amazing opportunity! A huge apartment located on the third floor in La Carihuela with 4 bedrooms just 3 minutes walk to the beach!

This apartment is located in 1 of the buildings of a complex of 4 and is on the 3rd floor.

From the staircase you enter a common hall on each floor where 2 flats are located.

Upon entering the hall of the flat, to the right is the fully equipped kitchen.
Attached to the kitchen is a closed balcony that is now used as a laundry room/shed.
There is a small single bedroom with bathroom on this side.
This bedroom would have the possibility of being attached to the kitchen to create a nice large dining kitchen.

To the left of the hall, a glass door leads you into a spacious 30m2 living room with large windows allowing lots of light in and also enjoying the beautiful view.

There is a large balcony at the front that can be reached from the living room and also from the adjacent bedroom.
Furthermore, the flat has 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms.

All bedrooms have fitted wardrobes and the whole flat is double-glazed.
The living room and bedroom both facing south have air conditioning.

In the basement of this well-maintained complex is a 7m2 storage room that belongs to the apartment.

The complex is surrounded with well-maintained gardens and at the front is a public swimming pool that is available for people from this complex to use at a reduced rate.

There is more than enough parking space at the rear. 

This is a very attractive flat in La Carihuela located on the 3rd floor with great views but unfortunately the building does not have a lift..........
