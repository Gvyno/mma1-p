Rare and exclusive retreat in the Marbella Club Golf Resort, walking distance to the equestrian centre, driving range and the Club House. 

It basically is a plot of 4.600 m2 surface plus another plot of 4.100 m2 which is classified as private green zone, meaning it has no building allowance but it gives plenty of extra forest and privacy. The buildable plot already has the guest house built and a flat surface to build the main house. There is also a fabulous swimming pool. 

This property is strategically located in a secluded setting close to the main facilities of the resort: Restaurant Club House, golf course and equestrian center.
