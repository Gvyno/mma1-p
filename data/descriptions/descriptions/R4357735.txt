Beautiful plot in the rural area of sabinillas only 3 min drive and 10 min walk, with a plot of 7.200m2 planted with fruit trees and more than 100 avocado trees.

The house is more than 50 years old and has been maintained over the years but with the possibility to make a more recent house with an investment. 
The house has 2 bedrooms, a living room with fireplace and kitchen, and another living room.
The house has mains electricity and the water needs to be connected from the entrance of the finca to the house as they use water from the community and it is a very mineral water because it comes from a deposit in which there are sulphur stones, very good for the skin, known as the baths of the hedionda.

There is also a small garage which would also need a little renovation.
