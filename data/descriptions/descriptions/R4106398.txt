 According to the urban plan approved by the municipal plenary session in March last year, the construction of 2,847 homes is planned, aligned with new roads that will cross the land framed by the towns of Monsálvez, El Olivar and Cortijo de Maza, and grouped around a golf course that will have an area of ​​450,000 square meters, divided into six sectors, and will offer a minimum of 18 holes. This will add tremendous value to the property whilst not obstructing any of the magnificent views from the plot.

 Proof of the relevance of this project is that its urbanization works alone are valued at 60 million euros, including the external expenses that its promoters will have to assume, the construction of the roads and the completion of the golf course.

 Therefore, it would be an excellent investment as a support business for the golf course or similar due to its considerable extension of the farm (equestrian center, stables, hotel chain due to its proximity to the airport, etc. ...)

 Likewise, 330,353 square meters are reserved for green areas.
