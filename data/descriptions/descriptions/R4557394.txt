This is a rare opportunity for a charming top floor beach-side property on the highly desirable Las Gaviotas complex.  The apartment is a two minute walk to the marina at La Duquesa and a genuine stones throw to the beautiful beach and the Mediterranean Sea.

There are excellent link roads to Estepona and Marbella.  The Andalusian white villages of Manilva, Casares and Gaucin are a pleasant drive away.  Gibraltar and Malaga airports can be reached in 20 mins and under an hour repectively.

Las Gaviotas is a small, low rise complex of apartments.  It is a very well established community in a fantastic location and with low running costs.

The property is made up of two individual top floor apartments separated by a secluded, south facing terrace.

The apartments have been tastefully reconfigured and now incorporate 3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms whilst retaining its original charm. It is in wonderful condition, fully furnished and ready for immediate occupation.

Entrance to the property is via an open staircase off a small plaza and onto the large, private sunny terrace.  This terrace is secluded, south facing and is a perfect entertaining area. 

Entrance from the main terrace leads to a large open plan kitchen/dining room with a fireplace. There is access to a second south facing terrace with beautiful sea views. Double doors lead to the third bedroom which is currently used as a second living room.

A hall leads to the main bedroom with fitted wardrobes and a full bathroom.

On the opposite side of the private terrace is an independent studio apartment. This has a large living room/bedroom and a useful kitchenette. There is also a separate bathroom.

This unique top floor Las Gaviotas, Duquesa apartment has character features including marble floors and the south facing aspect means the property is warm and bright throughout the year.
