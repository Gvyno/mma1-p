Tucked away in the mountain village of Benahavis is this hotel. A small rustic, yet elegant world of great smiles, warm welcomes, refined service and a true andalucian feel awaits you. The true feeling of being far away, yet you are at home away from home. 3 different types of themed rooms offer a variety of choice, just as much as our excellent dining... Additional services and amenities, on par with reasonable prices, make us stand out and win over both Benahavis visiting tourists and Costa del Sol golfers. Their restaurant is a rustic, yet elegant restaurant, specializing in serving Creative Andalusian Cuisine. Daily, the Chef goes to the surrounding markets finding what is fresh and in season to create six daily changing menus. Hence guests can choose from six starters, eight main courses and four desserts. The atmosphere is similar to a very cozy living room, where you will feel at home and get pleasure from a truly wonderful cuisine and evening. Contact us for more information!
