This UNIQUE venue is one of the very few authentic Cortijos left in the Marbella area and is situated in a quiet valley near to the picturesque white village of Benahavís and 10 minutes from Marbella and Puerto Banús, it is also just 1 kilometre from the main road and less than 5 minute drive to the beautiful beaches of the Costa Del Sol in Spain.

Recently renovated yet retaining all of its original charm the property resembles a tropical oasis with its numerous palm trees and flower beds, lawned terraces and romantic shaded courtyards. Its secluded location makes it possible to truly escape the crowds at this relaxing and tranquil retreat whilst still being able to enjoy the nightlife of Puerto Banús and Marbella.

The property has been renovated from the original equestrian centre into an ideal villa with self-contained cottages, retaining the eclectic mix of Spanish and Moroccan décor which was chosen to suit the building's traditional Moorish architecture. The Cortijo was sympathetically converted from an equestrian centre some 45 years ago by its present owners to include 11 Casitas and a 3 bedroom Cottage, sleeping a total of 28 guests plus extra beds.

The Cortijo comes together with a fully separate big independent Villa, which is the Main House. This exclusive private Villa has its own unique style with beams on the ceiling, large open spaces and pretty corners everywhere. It has its own exotic garden, walk-in pool & outdoor jacuzzi. There are 4 bedrooms/1 large bathroom with separate shower and 2 bathrooms with shower & toilet, sleeping max 11 guests with extra beds/cots in some of the rooms.
