Beautiful beachside apartment with beautiful gardens and access to the beach from the urbanisation. Costalita is a very sought after area and this property is close to Atlas International School, EIS and the Scandinavian School so perfect for a family. 

2 very good restaurants are near the complex. The facilities and shops of Bel Air are walking distance where you have bars, restaurants, supermarkets, pharmacy and much more. 

This 2 bed 2 bath apartment is in immaculate condition. 

The lovely bright open plan lounge / diner has doors opening out onto a nice covered terrace overlooking the lush tropical gardens below. 

The kitchen is of a good size and if fully fitted with door through to a utility room.

The master bedroom has an en suite bathroom.

The guest bedroom has access to a family bathroom. 

The communal pool area is very well maintained and has a beautiful landscaped garden surrounding the whole development which is gated and secure. 

It is a lovely walk within the private gardens to access the private access to the beach directly from the community.

There is a garage with lift to the apartment and a storage room.

Must be seen to be fully appreciated, this is really a lovely holiday home or home for full time living.

24 hour security.
