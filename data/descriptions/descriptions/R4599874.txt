2 bedroomed apartment in the center and only 150 meters from the most beautiful beach in the most amazing small town, La Cala de Mijas.
Only 20 minutes from Malaga airport. La Cala is authentic and yet a town with lots of lovely restaurants, coffee places, small shops and wine bars.
The 70 m2 apartment is located on the 1st floor with a view of the city centre. There is a lift in the property and the apartment has 2 balconies facing the city,
where the coffee can be enjoyed while studying life on the street. Behind the kitchen is access to a small patio with a cozy Spanish atmosphere.
Bathroom with tub, lots of cupboards in the 2 bedrooms, one of which has access to its own balcony.
The apartment appears very bright and freshly painted, with nice light marble floors and the large doors in the living room draw the pulse of the small beautiful town right into the apartment.
Air conditioning, hot and cold.
An additional parking space can be purchased for the apartment, located in a locked parking garage approx. 70 meters away for 26,000 euros
A wonderful holiday home for those of you who dream of a haven in the south, in the middle of a small authentic Spanish town, close to the airport and 150 meters from the beach and the sea.
