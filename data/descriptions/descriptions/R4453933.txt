In the most popular area "Canca" of the village of Alora, stands this luxurious country house with lovely pool, phenomenal views and a beautiful plot. The house has a licence for first occupation (LPO).
The villa has 4 bedrooms and 4 bathrooms. Because the top floor has separate access, this is also a suitable property for starting a luxury B&B.
From Alora, we drive a short distance inland on a good road, partly paved. Arriving at the property, we see a beautiful villa in an elevated position with great views.
The village of Alora can be reached within 5 minutes and Malaga and the international airport and the shores of the Mediterranean Sea can be reached in 35 minutes! Alora has all amenities such as schools, medical centre, town hall, train and bus station and is very well served. It is a green valley with many lemon plantations and the world-famous walk "El Caminito del Rey" is nearby.

The current owner had the house built over 20 years ago. It is a stable house and the whole property is very tastefully decorated. As the views from the finca are breathtaking, there are several terraces on the first and second floor of this country house to enjoy the amazing scenery of the Valle del Guadalhorce! These terraces are accessible from the central hall and also from some of the bedrooms.
Arriving at the villa, we park the car on the landscaped terrace. Next to this terrace you will find the first of a total of two Era´s. A cultural heritage of this region and beautifully restored by the owner!
The beautiful solid wood front door gives access to the house and the living room. From the living room there is access to the kitchen, two bedrooms with en-suite bathrooms, the kitchen and the covered terrace.
The staircase to the first floor is spacious. When the house was built, the patio style that characterises many homes in Andalusia was incorporated into the design. At the top of the stairs there is access to a large roof terrace with phenomenal views. On the adjacent hallway there are two bedrooms, each with their own bathroom. There is access to the terrace and swimming pool and an entrance to the highest roof terrace.

The outdoor area and garden of this property are a gem. The entire plot is fenced and there are several footpaths, terraces and a great swimming pool! A real oasis around the house. There is a covered BBQ area, a separate area for the pool pump and nicely tiled areas for sun loungers. The property has plenty of space and total privacy with breathtaking views.
