Beautiful villa situated in a hid-away cul-de-sac in lower nueva Andalucia, with walking distance to shops, restaurants, Puerto banus and the beach.
It is a bright and sunny house with a zen-feel to it, and it also enjoys open views to the sea from the upstairs terrace.
Originally built in the late 60's and has since then undergone many renovations and upgrades, the latest in 2015.
The villa consists of open plan living-room and kitchen leading straight out to the garden with the swimming pool in front, one large bedroom with en-suite bathroom, another guest bedroom, and a guest toilet on the ground floor. A few steps takes you down to the third guest bedroom with en-suite bathroom. Upstairs is another living room together with a large master bedroom with en-suite bathroom.  In the garden there is also a surprisingly large Balinese-style cabana, ideal for enjoying the long summer nights, there is a BBQ-area to the side of the property and a work-room/storage below the house. 
The property has one garage and a carport in front of the house. Viewings highly recommended!
