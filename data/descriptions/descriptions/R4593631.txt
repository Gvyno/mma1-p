A rare opportunity to purchase in Los Balcones, one of the smallest communities of just 38 units within Los Arqueros Golf and is well situated close to the golf clubhouse, sports facilities and restaurants. The apartments and penthouses are set in a semi circle around a beautiful HEATED infinity pool providing a spectacular setting with uninterrupted views of the golf course, the mountains and the Mediterranean Sea.

The properties in Los Balcones are built over three levels, ground floor with gardens, first floor and penthouses with roof solariums. The high qualities and specification expected with Taylor Woodrow built properties are in evidence with cream marble floors, fully fitted kitchens with Bosch appliances and hot and cold air conditioning.
