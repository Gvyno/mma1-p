Nice corner apartment facing southwest, centrally located near Plaza Hispanidad and the market in Fuengirola. The apartment originally had three bedrooms, but one of the bedrooms has been combined with the living room to get larger areas. However, it can be restored if you need three bedrooms.
We enter a small hall with fitted wardrobe, directly to the left is the kitchen, which is fully equipped and has a separate laundry room and exit to an in-glazed balcony that is currently used as a storage space. The angled living room facing southwest contains a dining table, TV armchairs and a nice sofa group. From the living room you come out onto the terrace, which offers lovely afternoon sun with a view of the city, a park and the Mijas mountains. If we continue from the hall and keep to the right, we will find the two bedrooms and two bathrooms with shower, one of which is en-suite.
The apartment is sold furnished and is in very good condition with new windows, rewired electricity, air conditioning, built-in wardrobes and filters for drinking water. A very nice apartment within easy walking distance to cafes, restaurants, pharmacies, supermarkets, etc. About 700 meters from the beach.
The building has communal pool open during the summer.
