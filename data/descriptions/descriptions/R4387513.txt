Beautiful villa with uninterrupted panoramic views of the entire coast and breathtaking sea views, on clear days you can see Gibraltar and Africa. This recently renovated villa consists of a beautiful modern open plan kitchen, generous living room with fireplace, master bedroom with en-suite bathroom, 2 guest bedrooms with 2 additional bathrooms with shower, spacious terrace and swimming pool. A double garage and indoor parking are also available. Below the villa there are 3 independent studios. Located within walking distance of the sea and all amenities such as supermarket, shops, weekly market and numerous restaurants makes this property an ideal investment home as well as a permanent home.

This exceptional villa with a lot of potential can therefore serve as a B&B or be rented out on a long or short term basis. The villa is currently rented out for short term holidays and therefore has the necessary tourist license.
Access to the property is through a gate where you walk down a few steps to get to the house, but there is also an alternative entrance without stairs for wheelchair users.

The 3 studios have a separate entrance, but at the same time they are accessible from the villa via 2 stairs, one on the side of the villa, at the main entrance and one by the pool, so that both parts can be separated perfectly.

Do not miss this exceptional opportunity and contact us for more information or to make an appointment.
