VILLA REFURB PROJECT IN ELVIRIA WALKING DISTANCE TO AMENITIES AND THE BEST BEACHES IN MARBELLA EAST

Here you have the perfect opportunity to purchase a large plot with a villa and guesthouse walking distance to commercial areas of Elviria and the best beaches of the Costa del Sol. 5 minute walk to amenities and 10 minute walk to the beach! 

The villa comprises 3 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms and an additional guest toilet in the main house. There is a roof top solarium which offers partial sea views overlooking the mature green areas of Elviria beach side.  The guest house, which has recently been completely renovated, is distributed with a kitchen area, bedroom and bathroom, its self contained with its own seperate entrance. The main living area, which needs full renovation, offers two bedrooms with ensuite bathrooms, a guest toilet and dining-lounge area and a fully equipped kitchen. 

It has also garage space for 1 car and plenty of storage space, the land is 1084 m2 and needs complete landscaping and a pool built. All the m2 are fully registered and if potential buyer interested in adding an additional floor they would have to remove some m2 from the main area. Overall a project with a lot of potential due to its location and plot size.
