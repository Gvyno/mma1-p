This modern and lavish villa is situated in the upscale and peaceful residential area of Río Real Golf, just east of Marbella town, close to beautiful beaches and fantastic golf courses. Whether you're in search of a permanent residence, a holiday home, or an investment opportunity, this four-bedroom, three-and-a-half-bathroom villa spanning two floors has it all – even sea views from ground floor! 

The first floor serves as the entrance, featuring a hall and a spacious open kitchen, living, and dining area that seamlessly opens to the private garden and heated swimming pool through high sliding doors. Full-height windows can be retracted into the walls, merging the interior and exterior living spaces, allowing the owners to enjoy Marbella's wonderful climate all year round. Additionally, there's a master bedroom with an ensuite bathroom, a guest toilet, and a storage room on the first floor. Directly from the kitchen, there's access to outdoor space for a washing machine, dryer, and storage. The patio can easily be covered with a roof.

Moving to the second floor, you'll find another ensuite master bedroom and two bedrooms sharing a family bathroom. All bedrooms feature floor-to-ceiling sliding doors leading to a large terrace with breathtaking views of Marbella town, the La Concha Mountain, and even the Mediterranean Ocean extending to Gibraltar and Africa. There's also the option to add one more spacious bedroom upstairs to a northern side terrace.

The stunning garden boasts a generously sized heated swimming pool, an outdoor shower, and beautiful tropical plants. The villa faces west, allowing you to enjoy sunshine all day long and witness incredible sunsets. Covered terraces and pergolas provide a pleasant shelter for those who prefer shade.

Built with high standards, modern techniques, and home appliances, the villa offers water-circulated underfloor heating throughout the house, electric floor heating in bathrooms, and air conditioning for optimal comfort. Accessible from the peaceful blind alley street is a closed parking space (30m2) for two cars.

The fully furnished villa is ready for enjoyment with family and friends, making it naturally ideal for rentals too. The location is prime, just a 5-minute drive to Marbella, a 10-minute drive to Puerto Banús, and a delightful 10-minute stroll to the beach with the charming Trocadero Beach restaurant. Did you know that Río Real Golf Club will open their beach restaurant in 2024? Nearby, you have fantastic golf courses such as Santa Clara, Marbella GCC, and Río Real, all just minutes away. How about cycling from home all the way to San Pedro on the beach promenade? It's a perfect way to explore your neighborhood.

The Rio Real area has attracted the interest of many investors. For instance, Villa Padierna Hotels & Resorts is planning a five-star luxury hotel in collaboration with the renowned Four Seasons luxury brand just south of La Finca de Marbella. Additionally, the renovation of Hotel Incosol will bring even more vibrancy to the area.

With these investments in an area close to amenities such as the beach, golf, and Marbella town, we anticipate that the value of properties will continue to rise.
