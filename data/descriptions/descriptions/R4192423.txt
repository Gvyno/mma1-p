Wonderful, free and bright location in one of the houses above the marina in Estepona. This well-maintained and renovated apartment has the best location with a west-facing window and balcony. Large and spacious living room with dining area and kitchen in direct connection. Outside is the lovely balcony with a lovely view down to the marina!
The bedroom has good wardrobes and the bathroom is directly adjacent to the bedroom. Marble floors and double glazing in all windows. Water is included in the association fee. In this pleasant urbanization, which is much appreciated by Scandinavians, there are no less than two nice swimming pools and a paddle tennis court. But what you like and appreciate most is that you can live here without a car, everything is within walking distance. To Estepona's cozy alleys in the old town, it takes a quarter of an hour to walk along the promenade. In the area there are two large grocery stores, lots of multicultural restaurants, fun bars and the fishing port's genuine seafood restaurants. Around the corner you will find one of the coast's finest beaches with cozy beach bars.
It takes 50 minutes to Malaga airport, 15 minutes to Marbella's shopping strip and Puerto Banús nightlife is just 10 minutes away.
The area is guarded and there is an intercom. Rental potential is 110% in this popular area with walking distance to everything. There are two grocery stores in the neighborhood and the local buses stop outside. This nice apartment offers comfortable, lovely holiday accommodation with a golden edge!
