This is a great opportunity to buy a property on the beachside of Marbella, just behind the beach and Cabopino sand dunes for a very low price. Perfect as a second property holiday home investment. The apartment itself is quite small split on two levels with its own internal stair case. This property is also just a few minutes walk to the port of Cabopino. It could also suit an investor looking for a buy to renovate property. This complex has an amazing pool and communal garden. Low fees and private storeroom included in the price
