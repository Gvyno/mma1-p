Magnificent plot with a beautiful view in a picturesque place "La Mairena" in Spain on the Costa del Sol. La Mairena is a natural park protected by UNESCO. Cork oaks are not uncommon here, and the plot offers views of the nature reserve. It is not surprising that Julio Iglesias himself chose this place to build his own house.
It should be noted that the scenic landscape will always cheer the owner, since the site borders a protected area, which is not subject to any construction in the city plan.
Throughout the day you can hear the singing of the birds and, sometimes, you can even see foxes.
This area is very famous not only for its clean air and beauty, but also for the fact that this is where the famous tennis school "Hofsäss Tennis Akademie" is located, among which Steffi Graf himself. Due to the fact that La Mairena has grown lately and many Europeans live here, a prestigious German school opened here in 2008.
If you do not have time to dedicate yourself to construction, we can offer the service of an architect to create an individual project.
This land is unique in that it is possible to build 2 villas on it, a large one with a view to the sea and the nature reserve and a second smaller house to resell and return almost half of the capital invested in construction.
