This is an exceptional town house in a very sought after complex just a few minutes walk from the beach and Cabopino Marina.  The house is located in a gated complex with two swimming pools and nice gardens.  The present owners have upgraded the house by tasefully adding extra rooms in the basement level that was previously used as a garage.
