Magnificent villa with panoramic views of the sea and mountains from the same living room due to its great location at mid-height in Elviria.
 Perfect height to have these wonderful views and at the same time not too far to walk to the beach.

 Villa with 3 bedrooms with their respective bathrooms en suite in the main house plus a complete apartment for service or guests, totally independent. 
The lake-shaped pool is especially large for what you see in other villas, and from it you can enjoy stunning sunsets watching as the sun sets behind La Concha. Sierra de Marbella 
The villa is very particular and unique in Elviria, it has a lot of potential to reform it and expand it with a second floor or leave it in the same state.
 It has a parking space for 4 cars.
 Unique Opportunity
