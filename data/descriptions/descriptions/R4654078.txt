Wonderful, recently refurbished, townhouse in Villacana, Estepona, just a short walk away from the prestigious Villa Padierna Raquet Club and the beach. 
This townhouse has a lot to offer! The master bedroom has its own dressing room (previously another bedroom), two sitting rooms and a lovely entertainment / bar area on the lower level, with direct access to the patio and communal garden & pool. 
It is also sold with a self-contained studio apartment which is currently rented long term. Great as an extra income or investment! It comes with a garage. A property that offers a lot of potential.
