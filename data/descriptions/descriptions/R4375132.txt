Exceptional villa with unique plot! Unique as the size and the location of the villa and the plot, along the Costa del Sol, you will not find again. Located very close to the beach and to the famous village of La Cala de Mijas, this mansion offers mature gardens, privacy and a large pool area. The house was built 1975 with top standards and quality and has an excellent structure. The construction was done on two levels and already considered a central heating. The design and layout of the house is very open and offers large living areas, almost all bedrooms are ensuite, a separate guest apartments, acess everywhere to the large terraces, the garden and the pool. It would need some reform and updating, but the value is the plot and its location! Eventually interesting to split the plot and to built two or three new villas!
