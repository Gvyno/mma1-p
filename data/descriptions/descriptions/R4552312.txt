Fabulous corner apartment with large wrap around terrace in Cala Azul a very sought after complex as it is within walking distance of all amenities and beach.

This apartment is on the 1st floor, walk through the door to a hall area and on the right you have a fully fitted kitchen, to the left you have two bedroom and two bathrooms, the master bedroom is ensuite with a bath and the bedroom leads out to the terrace.  The 2nd bathroom has a shower.  Straight through the hall and you have your sitting/dining room which also leads out to the large terrace.  

The apartment has air con/ heating, individual units in all rooms.  Marble floors in the apartment except for the bathrooms and kitchen.  

The apartment comes with underground parking and store room.

There are really nice well kept communal gardens and has two pool areas and a small childrens playground.

One of the biggest assets of this apartment is the location, not many apartments are on the market at present that are walking distance to everything.  You are only a 10 mins walk down to the beach front and the centre of La Cala de Mijas.  La Cala is an old fishing village and has plenty of really nice restaurants, chiringuitos on the beach, supermarkets, shops and open air market twice a week.  You really have everything on hand.  Also you are on the Marbella - Fuengirola bus route.  

For those of  you who like golf, there are numerous course close by and  you can even walk to the 9 hole course at La Noria.
