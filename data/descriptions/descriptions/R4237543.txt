Lovely beachside villa in the well established urbanization of Costabella on the east of Marbella.

This charming 3 bedroom villa is located in a quiet cul de sac only few steps from the best beaches near El Rosario in Marbella. There´s a large living room with direct access to a nice large sunny terrace facing south-east and its well kept garden and pool.

The house also has central heating and a little covered garage for 1 car and a storage room with water boiler and deposit.

Only a few minutes walk to the beach and a very well known beach club in Marbella, only few minute drive to shops and restaurants.
