The plan to live a different life, in a place where what stands out most is the quality of life, comes to mind on more than one occasion throughout our stressful routine.
The Costa del Sol is the preferred vacation destination for people from northern European countries, and those of us who live there know that it is possible to enjoy life every day.
On this occasion, I present to you a unique possibility!
Urban Plot in Don Silverio town in Mijas, with very close access to the highway, and just 5 minutes by car from the center of Fuengirola.
It has 520m2, views of the sea and the mountains from the bottom of the plot.
The streets and sidewalks have been recently renovated by the city council (September 2023), and in the neighborhood there are very good quality houses, in addition to having 3 supermarket options in the surrounding areas(Lidl, Aldi, The Food Co.)
Who wouldn't love to live in a home built to their liking on the Costa del Sol?
Do not wait more!
