NEW TO THE MARKET

Very spacious, two bedroom apartment for sale in the luxury development Los Monteros Hill Club.

The apartment, which benefits from one of the best panoramic and unobstructed views in Marbella, was originally reserved off plan by the current owner due to its privileged position within the development. Since it was constructed in 2007, it has only been used by its owner occasionally, as a holiday home.

The apartment boasts a very generous entertaining space with an ample master bedroom (with en-suite bathroom) and a spacious guest bedroom with a second bathroom. Both the living room and the master bedroom have direct access to the main terrace with views over Marbella and its bay.  

Due to its southwest orientation, it is possible to enjoy the sun throughout the day and unforgettable sunsets in the evening. Many improvements to the apartment have been made by the owners over the years including: replacement of air conditioning unit, enclosed kitchen terrace, new shower floors, fitted bathroom cabinets, a "magic" glass window in the main bathroom.

The apartment is being sold with the added bonus of two private garage spaces and two large storage rooms. 

Los Monteros Hill Club is a luxury development with 24-hour concierge service, gym, sauna, infinity swimming pool and a wonderful, landscaped garden.
