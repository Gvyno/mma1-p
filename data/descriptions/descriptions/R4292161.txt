This 3 bedroom, 3 bathroom large penthouse apartment is located in Costa Casares.

Incredible sea views from the large terrace, including Gibraltar, Morocco and the mountains.

The apartment also includes upgrades such as electric blinds and underfloor heating.

The apartment has been finished to a high standard, with the furniture included in the sale.  The flooring is travertine throughout.  

Located in the urbanisation Albatross, it is a very spacious property with good size bedrooms and bathrooms.  

An additional bonus is the elevator which goes directly into the penthouse.   

The urbanisation is gated, and is well maintained and managed.  There are 3 communal pools to use all year round, plus children´s pools, all located in an area which is perfect for lounging on a sunbed and relaxing.

Located 10 mins drive from Estepona, it is perfectly situated to enjoy the calm of the countryside but still close to everything the Costa del Sol has to offer.
