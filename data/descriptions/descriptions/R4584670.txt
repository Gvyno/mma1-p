In the heart of Benalmádena, a distinctive villa invites you into a realm of understated elegance and practical luxury. 

Boasting over 300sqm of covered space on a generous 950sqm plot, this two-story residence stands as a testament to refined living.

Upon entering, an expansive hall seamlessly connects the garage, dining area, and two bedrooms, including the master suite. The southeast orientation of the bedrooms ensures a daily spectacle—the mesmerizing sunrise over the sea. The master bedroom, adorned with an en-suite bathroom and double sinks, reveals a thoughtful touch with a spacious walk-in closet and a comfortable sitting/reading area overlooking sea, garden, and pool views.

The dining area, positioned as the central hub, introduces a vintage-style kitchen delicately separated by a wooden frame. This subtle division allows the air and the gentle sounds of a Moorish fountain to add an element of serenity. The result is a captivating backdrop of panoramic sea views.

The formal dining and living room, unfolds with ample space for a large sitting area and a fireplace. The highlight is the captivating sea views that complete this space. A guest toilet discreetly complements this level.

Ascending to the upper level, a cozier ambiance unfolds. 

An office with an ample terrace, sheltered by a pergola, beckons for moments of contemplation. This terrace seamlessly connects to a secondary living room featuring wooden beams, a fireplace, a chaise-long facing a large flat TV, a piano, and extensive sea views—an ideal retreat for winter afternoons.

A large bedroom adjacent to this area adds to the upper-level charm, complemented by a well-appointed bathroom.

Outdoors, the options are plentiful—access the area through flat alleys bordered by fruit treeson the sides of the house, or by a staircase beside the main terrace. The lower level unveils a 10 x 5 m pool surrounded by a tiled area, a BBQ space under a pergola, and a practical guest apartment with a kitchenette and bathroom, doubling as an outdoor escape.
