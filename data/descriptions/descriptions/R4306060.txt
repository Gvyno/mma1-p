Villa Hibisco welcomes you to Southern Spain with its stunning traditional architecture, featuring a bright white exterior that immediately catches your eye. 

The arched terraces outside add character to the property while paying homage to its traditional style. The interior design is contemporary and modern, reflecting the recent refurbishment. The modern boho-chic style is characterised by light tones that decorate the spaces, creating an open and seamless atmosphere. 

The double-height ceiling in the living area amplifies the space even more, which adds an airy feel to the living space. The kitchen is a statement piece with elegant assembly and plenty of counter space for those who enjoy cooking, along with coming fully equipped with state-of-the-art kitchen appliances. 

Each bedroom in the villa carries the same sophisticated and chic design, with its own elegant modern bathroom, complete with branded Villa Hibisco robes and towels. The outdoor terrace areas are generous, with a garden terrace area that surrounds the property and provides ample room for sunbathing, alfresco dining, barbecues and relaxation. 

There is also a private pool to be enjoyed on hot summer days. The rooftop terrace is perfect for summer nights or simply watching the sunset. 

Villa Hibisco is located in the Nueva Andalucia residential area, within the private and secure Marbella Country Club community. Here, residents can indulge in the many nearby amenities.
