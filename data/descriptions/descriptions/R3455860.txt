Nice town house on the edge of the village in a fantastic location, with views of the mountain, and in a very quiet street but only a few steps from the town centre. The house has four floors and has been recently renovated, distributed as follows:

Ground Floor: small living-dining room, bedroom, fully fitted kitchen that leads to a patio, and a shower room.
First Floor: two double bedrooms and a bathroom.
Second Floor: three bedrooms, a WC and a utility room.
Top Floor: large covered roof terrace with beautiful views of the village and the mountains. 

The house is sold fully furnished and equipped. There is the option to buy a nearby plot of rustic land at a reduced price if bought together with this house.
