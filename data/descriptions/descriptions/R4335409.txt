Marvelous country side detached stone villa built in two levels with super high wooden ceilings. Located in the andalusian  white village of Casares where you can find all kind of typical Spanish restaurants, shops and amenities and only 20 minutes  drive from Estepona and Sabinillas. Surrounded by its 14 hectare and with south east facing the villa demands awesome views to the field and the mountains. The plot is completed gated except the part bordering the Natural Park, it has a well water, a stream that crosses the land and a natural spring, lots of fruit trees as:  pears, avocados, lemon, quince, chestnut, pomegranates, pines and olive trees all wash down with natural irrigation. Viewing is highly recommended!!
