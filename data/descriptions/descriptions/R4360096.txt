These two plots are located within 10 minutes walking to the historical center. Each plot has a surface of 155 and 172sqm and at the moment there are two old properties build one of them 155 sqm and the other one 330sqm. 

According to the preliminary study, the option of constructing two blocks consisting of a ground floor and two upper floors is being considered. Without accounting for access to the basement for parking, two commercial spaces could be arranged on the ground floor. On the upper floors, there is a plan to accommodate two residences each. In summary, there would be a total of two blocks comprising 8 exterior apartments, either studios or with an independent bedroom, along with 4 commercial spaces on the ground floor. This proposal represents an excellent opportunity to develop apartments intended for long-term rental in a highly convenient location, close to the city center.

This plot does not have license or project done.
