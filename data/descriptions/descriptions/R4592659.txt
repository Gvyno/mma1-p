Spacious apartment with sea views near the fishing port of Marbella and the beach.

This beautiful apartment has a spacious and bright living room with sea views. It originally had three bedrooms, but has been converted to two to offer ample living room space.

It also has two full bathrooms, a kitchen and a large terrace of 24 square meters, ideal for relaxing and enjoying the views. It is very easy to convert back to three bedrooms, if desired.

In addition, the garage space is included for convenience. The complex in which it is located is gated and has a swimming pool to cool off during the hot days. And best of all, the beach is right across the street.

This apartment has a west orientation, which makes it very sunny for much of the day, ideal for enjoying the views and the wonderful climate of Marbella. And best of all, it is just steps away from all the necessary services. Don't miss the opportunity to live in this beautiful property!
