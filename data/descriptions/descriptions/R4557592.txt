House for integral reform in Istán

We enter a village of 1,500 inhabitants, situated on the southern slopes of the Sierra de las Nieves and only 20 minutes from Puerto Banus. Currently there are more than 25 nationalities among its few inhabitants.

The village is very popular with cyclists and hikers. From Istán there are many signposted hiking trails. 

Water is very present in Istán. We can enjoy the source of the river Molino, the reservoir of La Concepción, as well as the different fountains in the village. 

If you are looking for a life in the mountains, surrounded by nature and only a short distance from the coast and urban life, this is the village for you!

Enjoy being able to build your house on 3 levels on a plot of 26 m in this marvellous enclave!
