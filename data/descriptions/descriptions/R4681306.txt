This charming townhouse is located in one of the most beautiful and traditional squares of Alhaurín el Grande.

With a privileged location just 4 minutes from Gerald Brenan Avenue, this 6 bedroom, 3 bathroom house is a real architectural treasure. Its 182 built metres and 155 usable metres offer plenty of space for comfortable living.
The ground floor, clad in elegant marble, creates a welcoming entrance. The property has two laundry rooms, a patio and a terrace, allowing you to enjoy the fresh air and serenity of the outdoors.
