Very wide and large building plot located within the consolidated residential area of Monte Mayor Resort, Benahavis. The plot comprises 3807m2 and has a build allowance of 12% (internal constructed) for a single dwelling.  

Sea and mountain views - south and east facing. The plot is sloping, but terrific value for the size and potential.
