Excellent location! 

Great opportunity to obtain a villa with stunning panoramic views, south facing, lots of sun, large plot and close to the sea and all amenities.

With a plot of almost 800 m2 with space to build a swimming pool, the house is distributed as follows: spacious entrance hall, living-dining room with fireplace, large independent kitchen with exit to the garden, large master bedroom ensuite, as well as two other bedrooms and a complete bathroom. There is also a veranda on the first floor with splendid views, which could be closed off or converted into an extension of the house to build more bedrooms.

On a top level accessed from the south entrance of the property, there is a large garage for two vehicles, as well as a room currently in use as an office which could also be used as a spacious storage room or play area.

The property represents an excellent opportunity to renovate to your taste, enjoying a privileged location, views and orientation.
