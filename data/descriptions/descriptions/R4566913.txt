New on the market light-flooded apartment in the sought-after urbanisation Alhambra del Mar with great orientation and a great terrace. Originally it had only one bedroom but a second small bedroom has been added. The apartment has been partially renovated and enjoys great views of Alhambra del Mar's lush gardens and fountains. With the beach promenade and Capuccino only a few steps of distance, this real gem offers a fantastic opportunity to enjoy life by the sea or as an investment with a great rental potential.
