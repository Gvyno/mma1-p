Spectacular and very impressive Andalusian cortijo with a great view over the sea and the mountains. A beautifully landscaped garden with a wide variety of vegetation and a spacious pool.
At entrance you immediately have the Wow factor. There is parking space for several cars and you have access to the large courtyard with the main building and two beautiful guest rooms.
The cortijo is divided over 3 floors. Entrance of the main house is a spacious living room with wood stove, and with high wooden ceilings on various levels and a dining room. The painted windows give a beautiful light. From the living room you go to a large covered terrace with a great view of the beautiful garden and pool. From the dining room you enter the large fully equipped kitchen, a bedroom with bathroom and a toilet.
Through a beautiful wooden open staircase you reach the first floor with two spacious bedrooms that share a bathroom and a large bedroom with en suite bathroom.
The under floor has large spaces that you could use for example as a gym, cinema, banquet hall and wine cellar.
On the right side of the courtyard are two beautiful guest rooms with living room, bedroom and a fully equipped bathroom.
The property is beautifully furnished and is sold fully furnished, ready to move in immediately. But a renovation/modernisation is highly desirable
A fantastic Andalusian CORTIJO in a fantastic location that needs to be seen!
