Spacious first floor apartment with panoramic sea views, three double ensuite bedrooms, a large lounge, separate kitchen and utility room, as well as a large terrace.  Centrally located within a high end urbanisation within walking distance of the amenities of Marbella old town, in one of the best areas of the Costa del Sol, the apartment boasts impressive views, and oversize rooms throughout.

The property is classically appointed and comprises a large lounge with open fireplace, as well as three double bedrooms, each with its own ensuite bathroom; including the owners&#039; bedroom suite which offers sea views and direct access to the terrace, as well as an oversize bathroom with jacuzzi bathtub, double basins and a walk-in shower, as well as a separate dressing area. There is a fully equipped kitchen which has Siemens appliances, a double American fridge, and a separate utility room with its own small terrace.

There is a zoned underfloor heating system, as well as air-conditioning throughout. The property is to be sold alongside two large underground parking spaces and a large private store room which are accessible via stairs as well as an elevator.

As with many properties built in Marbella in the early 2000s, the complex does not have a current License of First Occupation.  Whilst this is not uncommon, it is something that you should be aware of as a buyer. It does however have a certificate of no urban infraction which has recently been issued by Marbella town hall.

A substantial and very well located luxury three bedroom apartment with excellent views and easy access to all amenities.  Viewings are recommended.
