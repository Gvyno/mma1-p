Welcome to Casa Ciprés: a delightful 4-bedroom villa that has just been completely renovated and sold fully furnished and decorated in a Mediterranean style.

Nestled in a small cul-de-sac of Paraíso Alto in Benahavís, it stands out for its tranquil setting and impressive panoramic views of the sea and golf course.

Every room has been carefully designed to create a homely and cozy feeling with high-end finishes.

Spanning three levels, the house unfolds its charm:
- the main floor boasts a superb dining room seamlessly connected to the open-plan kitchen. This has all the storage space you need, quality appliances and a utility room hidden behind a cupboard door. A few steps down the dining room, you'll enjoy a generous and bright living area with an open fire connecting to a large terrace with dining and sitting areas. From the lounge and the terrace, you'll be impressed by the infinity views over the sea. This level also hosts a large bedroom with an ensuite bathroom, a cloakroom, and a guest toilet.
- the first floor reveals a very spacious master bedroom with a huge en suite bathroom with shower and dressing and a sun-soaked terrace. 
- and the lower level, accessible only via the external terrace, hosts two additional bedrooms sharing a bathroom. It's an ideal space for accommodating teenagers or guests.

As part of an intimate community comprising four villas, Casa Ciprés shares a nice swimming pool and well-maintained green areas. 
This property combines the privacy and independence of a villa with the advantages of living in a community, relieving you of the responsibility for the swimming pool and gardens.

The property is the ideal setting to share quality moments with family or friends, offering a worry-free experience when it comes to maintenance.

Undoubtedly, Casa Ciprés is a MUST VIEW property!
