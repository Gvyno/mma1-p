Wonderful ground floor apartment in Estepona.
Located in the west of Estepona, we find this fantastic apartment in the Buenas Noches area. It is located in the popular Bermuda Beach urbanization, just 5 minutes by car from Estepona, on the beachfront between the La Duquesa and Estepona marinas. It is located within a gated complex with several swimming pools and well-maintained green areas. Great rental potential for both vacation and long term.
The apartment is distributed in a spacious and bright living room facing south. The kitchen is completely equipped.
The property has three bedrooms and two bathrooms, one of the rooms with direct access to the terrace.
The apartment includes an underground parking space and two storage rooms.

Its location is unbeatable since it is a few minutes walk from the beach
