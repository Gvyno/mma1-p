In the heart of Los Arqueros golf lies the urbanisation Avalon. It is an oasis of peace and comfort. 
The beautiful corner flat has three spacious bedrooms and two beautifully fitted bathrooms, all bathed in luxury. The bright, airy living room and kitchen adjoin the covered terrace, ensuring that you can enjoy the sun both winter and summer. Outside, a wide corner terrace stretches out; awnings along all facades ensure that you can enjoy the outdoors even during summer days. Since the flat's location, you have wide and beautiful views from every room, but others cannot look in. 
A garage and very spacious storage room offer practical convenience, facilitating every aspect of daily life. 
An inviting swimming pool surrounded by lush greenery invites refreshment on hot days, while the children's pool provides a playful space for the youngest members of the family. This heated pool can also be enjoyed during the colder months. 
This flat is one of the nicest in the complex and has lots of extras (awnings, fly screens, white doors and cupboards, fully equipped and comprehensive kitchen, ...)
The furniture, bed and bath linen and kitchenware can be bought separately as a package for the price of 25,000€
