Inside/Outside Living: This concept is central to the design of each villa, with the lounge and terrace seamlessly merging into one expansive living space. In key parts of the villas the windows disappear into the walls, framing the undisturbed, panoramic views of the natural surroundings.
Sustainable Luxury: Building for today without endangering tomorrow is a core value of the project, which is in the process of BREEAM certification. The design enhancements brought by this assessment result in sustainable homes that enhance the well-being of the people who live in them, help protect natural resources and make for a more attractive property investment.
