IDEAL AS AN INVESTMENT!! from minute one

Cozy two-bedroom apartment near the sea.
This apartment is superbly distributed.
Upon entering we find a spacious and bright living room, to the left a furnished kitchen with an island where we can serve our guests while we enjoy a good after-dinner meal.
Guest room with exterior window and a full bathroom.
Following the visit we find the main room with an en-suite bathroom and dressing room as well as access to the terrace, which will provide us with natural light throughout the room.
The terrace, as it could not be otherwise, also communicates with the living room, so the distribution of the house is the most recommended, with lateral views of the sea and the mountains. Without forgetting the garage space and storage room, included in the price.
The urbanization has a gym, paddle court and common areas where you can walk, two swimming pools will also welcome our hot days and if we feel like it, we can walk to the beach and the Torreblanca promenade.
