Living in the very centre of Sotogrande, in a strategic location, with plenty of light and space, rarely is this opportunity offered to us. We are talking about a corner townhouse, with many possibilities for reform and extension. Strategic location, close to all services and 3000m from the beach.    The house, oriented to the south west, is developed in three floors, of about 100 m2 approx. each one, being the ground and first floor destined to housing, and counting on a wide and spacious multifunctional basement floor, which can be accessed both from inside the house or from the garden by an exterior staircase.
Through the main door the house gives us the entrance to a hall and a guest toilet.  On the same floor is the independent kitchen, fully equipped with pantry area and a large living-dining room with fireplace, which gives access to the porch and the private enclosed garden with barbecue area.  On the first floor there are 3 double bedrooms with fitted wardrobes, a bathroom, and the master bedroom with fitted wardrobes and en-suite bathroom.
The large parking area for 3 cars, its corner location, as well as the possibility of extending it, make it a unique house among the houses in La Loma.
The urbanization La Loma de Sotogrande is located within Sotogrande Costa, it is a family residential area, very popular due to its large private communal areas: gardens, 2 paddle tennis courts, 2 tennis courts, children's playground and a private communal swimming pool. Close to both the beach and the service sector area and with quick and easy access.
