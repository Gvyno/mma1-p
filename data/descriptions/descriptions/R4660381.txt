New Listing! Re-Released Back to the Market at an Unbeatable Price for Sotogrande!

This is a Special Home. It´s a combination of Location, Modern Open-Plan Living, and Fun! 

The location is 1,3km to SIS, and only 700m to the So/Sotogrande Hotel and Almenara Golf. You can walk should you wish. The F Zone in Sotogrande is much loved for the ease of which you can do the school run.

The property is 539m2 built on a plot of 1572m2 and is perfect for large families year round, as a holiday home, or as a holiday rental investment. It is built for entertaining with loads of outside space, pool side chiringuito, and 6 or 7 bedrooms (depending how you configure 1 suite). 

The pool area is West Orientated so great afternoon sun & the pool is also heated for times when needed. There is a large roof top that has lots of potential for sun-worshippers! With views towards the golf and lake of the Almenara Golf Course.

All rooms are large, and with 6 bathrooms, it offers expansive living for multiple guests.

The plot is very low maintenance with grass around the pool and astro-turfed areas. 

The price is unbeatable for a stylish modern property of this ilk. In fact it is re-released at €1,650,000 having been previously marketed last year at €1,850,000. The price reduction is a reflection of the owners´ motivation to retire - nothing sinister, and as such, we expect the property to get a lot of viewings as we enter "selling season".
