NEW LISTING IN PUEBLA AIDA!


Great opportunity, rarely seen. We would like to offer you this beautiful 3-bed, 2-bath townhouse, split on two levels. As you walk into the property, you will find a spacious entrance hall (with plenty of storage space under the staircase) and three good-sized bedrooms with incorporated wardrobes, all of which benefit from either a window or door to the exterior, allowing the natural light in. Two of the bedrooms lead out to a private terrace, and the front bedroom looks out to the entrance terrace. Upstairs, you will find the living room area with an open-plan kitchen and guest bathroom. From the lounge, you step out onto your terrace with panoramic, breath-taking views of the surroundings, golf, and sea in the distance!
The property is in excellent condition and upgraded with a new open-plan kitchen, double-glazed windows, hot and cold air conditioning throughout the property, and a traditional fireplace in the lounge. The upper floor is ideally presented with its high-rise beamed ceilings, which enhance the property while absorbing the incredible views out on your terrace with a glass of wine "al fresco."

This magnificent Andalusian-style complex, one of the best known in Mijas Golf, is absolutely magical! The quiet streets, the beautiful courtyards with fountains, the abundance of flowers, and the white facades give the impression of walking through one of the typical Andalusian towns. It has four swimming pools where you can enjoy a bath in an incomparable setting, and even a French bowling area! All this, together with the splendid views, the tranquility, and the proximity to different urban centers, make Puebla Aida a highly desirable and pleasant place to live. Walking distance to the new 5-star hotel Byblos, public transport, taxi rank, and other amenities!
