This is a larger than average apartment in one of the best gated complexes in Calahonda. The owner has the tourist rental license in place and is willing to pass this on to the purchaser.  What really makes this property stand out when comparing it to other apartments is its exceptional layout with a larger than average living area, full sized windows leading out to its terrace with very good sea views.
