This apartment is situated in mid Calahonda next to the popular Siesta golf course and Club Del Sol sports facility. You can walk to some restaurants and a local bus service.It is only 5 minutes by car to the nearest beach and boardwalk which takes you all the way into either Cabopino port or the popular town of La Cala de Mijas. The swimming pool and garden areas are immaculate and it even has a heated indoor pool for the winter months. The property has been lovingly maintained by the current owner and offers spectacular sea views from both terraces. From the communal parking you can walk easily on one level directly to the front door without the need for an elevator. Must be seen to be appreciated!
