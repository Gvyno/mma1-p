Original 38 garage spaces, some converted into storage rooms and workshops. The building consists of 2 floors with separate entrances. On the upper floor are mainly storage rooms and 3 garage spaces. On the lower floor 8 garage spaces have been converted into a car repair shop. Both levels can be accessed by car. Very good return of investment! All places are rented out ! Contact us for any questions or appointments. Key is in the office.
