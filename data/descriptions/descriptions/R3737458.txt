Bank repossessed urban land designated for the construction of up to 22 single family homes or a two storey building situated in the centre of Benalmadena Pueblo.

This plot is a total size of 1.370m2 with a build allowance of 1.900m2 above ground and this does not include the patio and terrace areas.

The retaining walls and foundations have already been put into place at a great cost, so most of the ground work is already prepared.

The plot has a south west orientation with views to the sea and the coastline of Benalmadena.

Ideally located within walking distance to the centre of the town, transport links and a 20 minute drive to the centre of Malaga, the land is an excellent investment and development opportunity.
