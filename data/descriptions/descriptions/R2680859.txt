This plot consists of 1,082m2 with build ratio allowing a build of 378m2. Ideally located in the hillside urbanisation of San Diego between the village of San Roque and La Chullera in a residential area surrounded by other villas. A flat plot for building a stand-a-lone villa with potential for sea views to the east and south dependant on the house design and orientation of the property once built. The house can be built and raised 1m with an underbuild plus 2 storeys and this will give better views from the land. An ideal area for those wishing to commute to Gibraltar from the coast of Spain. An excellent price for this area.!!!
