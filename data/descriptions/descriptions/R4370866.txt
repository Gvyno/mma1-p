TRANSFERRED - A gold mine. Licensed Pizzeria Restaurant. Includes the recipe for the pizza dough that brought this trade to amazing success. And success would be assured by following the same path taken up to now. A trade for the whole year. After several years of great success and a lot of work, the owners need a break. This is the only reason why they put a crowded business up for sale.

The pizzeria is ready to enter and start working, it only needs a person with qualities like the current owners.

The place has two pizza ovens, one practically new. Fully equipped kitchen, bar and terrace for the development of the activity.

An investment that can be recovered in a very short time and the numbers (which the owners can demonstrate) support it. In addition to the take away that works phenomenally, delivery could be added that would give a further boost to the business.

A safe investment
