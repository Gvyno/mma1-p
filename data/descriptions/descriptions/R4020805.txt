Marvellous country house located 6km from the centre of Coín (8-minute car drive).

The property is located in a plot of over 7,000m² in a beautiful enclave offering fantastic views and with mature trees a very natural environment. The trees that we find on the property are mainly olives with some avocados.

The two-storey house offers 2 bedrooms, bathroom, kitchen, and living room with fireplace and direct access out onto a lovely, covered terrace. The ground floor is open-plan and measures 130m². This part of the house can have large windows installed and be divided to make other bedrooms, bathroom, an extra living room, playroom, or a separate apartment. It is currently used as a garage and for storage.

The swimming pool is a good size and very private. The road access to the house is good and tarmacked, whilst the property is fenced, has mains electricity and private well water.
