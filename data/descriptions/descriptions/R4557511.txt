This is a very well kept 2 bedroom 1 bathroom apartment in the popular complex of Refugio de Riviera and only a 10 minute walk to all of the amenities in Riviera del Sol including Restaurants, bars, supermarkets and the beach.  There are partial sea views from the properties terrace. An excellent investment at this price and so close to everything. The parking is on the street but comes with a large storage room
