Beautiful home with 2 bedrooms available in charming Puebla Tranquila
of Mijas. The location is very good, just 5 minutes to the centre of
Fuengirola and the best beaches of Costa del Sol, close to shops and
easy access to motorway which already can be seen from the terraces.

The Puebla Tranquila complex is a look a like of traditional
Andalucian mountain village with the height differences, stairs,
little alleys, plantations and squares. Stairs to the apartment and
stairs to the swimming pool area keep you in good physical condition
without a special effort!

The main bedroom is spacious, and the other bedroom has access to the second
terrace. There is one big bathroom and a separate toilet.

In the large living room is room for a big sofa and a dinner table, a
fireplace creating warmth and cosy atmosphere and from there is also
an entrance to the terrace.

In the kitchen there is lots of cupboards, an oven and a place for washing machine.

The apartment needs a facelift, which gives the new owner a great
opportunity to make it look like own. On the other hand, the  pleasant
views over Andalucian countryside and to the mountains needs no
improvement. This home is good value for the money and well worth a visit!
