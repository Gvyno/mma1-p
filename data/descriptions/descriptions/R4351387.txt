Townhouse recently renovated, located in the heart of San Pedro De Alcantara, in a renovated pedestrian street and close to all amenities such as stores, gym, bars and restaurants, schools, parks, pharmacies, etc..

The first floor consists of a hall where we find the staircase to access the second floor, in it is located the entrance to a fully equipped kitchen of large size and with little use, and the entrance to a large living room connected to the kitchen through a window as a breakfast bar, through which we access a room with a full bathroom en suite with shower. Inside the room we find the access to an inner courtyard through which we can go up through a spiral staircase to the roof which is prepared to make a third floor and in which is currently built a small laundry room.

The second floor consists of two bedrooms, one of them overlooking the front of the house and has access to a large balcony, a bathroom with bathtub and a large dressing room inside it, and another room with window to the inner courtyard.   

Ideal housing for families or investment due to the location, proximity to stores and high profitability thanks to the high demand for rental housing in the area.
