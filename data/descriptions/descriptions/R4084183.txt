As you walk the grounds you will discover superior landscaping that blends into the countryside adding the perfect touch of greenery whenever it is needed, while offering a wonderful contrast to the stark white pillars of your home. This villa has been created to offer you the choice of pleasures you desire most. Settle into the shade or catch some sun. Ease yourself into the pool a step at a time, and feel the cool water envelop you as you swim across the length of the pool. 
The idyllic life you lead at Nova Hill will likely be centred upon the living room. Designed to be the heart of your home, we have crafted an area that exudes refined elegance. As you sit between two open fireplaces sunlight streams in from immense southern facing windows. A tall ceiling soars overhead, with chandeliers catching and refracting light from inside or outside the home. Effortlessly connecting to an open plan kitchen, equipped with the latest technology. On the ground floor, you can also find a bedroom with ensuite bathroom.
You can find the impressive Master bedroom on the first floor, opulent design and superb views, with an ensuite bathroom and walk-in closet.
In the basement, you will feel serenity surrounds you.  An indoor pool gives you a cloistered area where you can both exercise and
relax as the moment strikes you. An equipped private Gym, Hammam and Wine cellar can be found on this level.
