The master bedroom has access to the terrace; the second bedroom has a balcony facing the afternoon sun.

The house has very good construction and finishing qualities, hot and cold AC by distribution ducts, marble floors, double glazed insulated windows, armored access door to the house, spacious built-in wardrobes with sliding doors, Siemens appliances in the kitchen, Grohe taps, Jacob Delafon toilets.
