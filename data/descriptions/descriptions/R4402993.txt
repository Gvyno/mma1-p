Beautiful newly renovated apartment with 2 bedrooms located in the cozy and popular urbanization Tio Charles Village in Benalmadena.

The apartment has recently undergone a renovation and includes, among other things, a new modern kitchen and bathroom - but the charming Andalusian details are kept throughout the apartment.

Lots of light from windows and doors at both ends of the home, which respectively give access to the private terrace with views of the mountains and the sea - and the front door which leads out to one of the complex's two swimming pools.

The pool is only a few meters away, which is why this apartment is perfect for both families with children and people who want easy accessibility.

Tio Charles is the perfect place to relax and enjoy life in quiet surroundings - with just a few kilometers to both the beach and bigger cities.

Gated and secure complex, 2 swimming pools, beautiful gardens and pleasant paths.
