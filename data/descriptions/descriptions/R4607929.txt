Excellent opportunity in the center of Estepona, a few steps away from all kinds of amenities and a short walk from the beach.

The apartment is on the third floor, it does not have an elevator, it has two bedrooms and a bathroom and an equipped kitchen, open to the living room and a shared solarium on the last floor,

The property is suitable both as a habitual residence and as an investment both long and short term.
