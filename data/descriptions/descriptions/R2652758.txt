The Spanish style villa with plenty of character is dominating the area from its elevated position and featuring a large basement with a garage, a games room and a storage room on the ground level. On the main middle level we find a reception hall, a large lounge, a dining room, a guest bathroom, a fully equipped kitchen, one bedroom on suite, a lovely covered terrace and a porch. The upper floor comprises a hall, four bedrooms, two bathrooms and a lovely open terrace. The east side of the plot is planted with fruit trees and part of it used as a hen house. On the raised main part of the plot we have a terraced area, a tennis court, a gardened area, a gazebo and a large pool. This quality countryside and very private property facing south has been recently built up to high standards and it is offering breathtaking, mountain, golf, sea and coastal views in all directions as far as the eye can see.
