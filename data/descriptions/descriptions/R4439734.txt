Unique property located in Punta Chullera Urbanization. On the elevated part of the plot of more than 3,200 square meters is a magnificent house completely renovated, in a modern style, with simple lines and large spaces, but preserving the Andalusian style of the original building. Comfortable entrance that leads to an office/study, and a spacious living room with fireplace with access to the terrace that has spectacular views of the sea and Gibraltar. Modern and spacious kitchen with a side exit where there is a cozy outdoor space. Large master bedroom with sea views with dressing room and ensuite bathroom, and 2 more bedrooms with bathroom. The house has a closed independent garage, and is equipped with a modern solar panel system that makes it autonomous, with minimal energy consumption. Beautiful pool with views also of the sea. Very different property, in a quiet enclave, surrounded by nature, but excellent communication, a few minutes from Torreguadiaro, Sotogrande and Estepona.
