The full bathroom, with bath and shower over is on the left of the hallway, the bathroom was fully reformed a couple of years ago.  The bedroom is ample with full wardrobes and leads on to the terrace which overlooks the pool and gardens.  There is a final door off the terrace which leads to the large lounge.  The lounge is very light and spacious since it has a further door leading to the utility terrace and two French style windows.
