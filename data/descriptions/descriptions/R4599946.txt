OPEN TO SERIOUS OFFERS! Interesting investment property only 3 minutes walk from the beach and 5 minutes to Marina De La Duquesa. The current owner started the renovations in january 2022 and wanted to make a 3* luxury boutique hotel of this, once, famous place. Unfortunately he passed away recently and his inheritors decided to sell the place as it is. There is a building license in place. The architect made an estimation of around € 300.000,- of the costs involved to finish the project. 
When the project is finished it will be a hotel with 12 rooms, with ensuite bathroom, 4 with their private terrace.
There will be a indoor breakfast area, breakfast kitchen, outdoor terrace, bar, elevator and several communal toilets. On the topfloor, also accesable with the elevator, is a penthouse with 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms, possible to rent out or as a managers-place.
The inheritors are willing to listen to reasonable offers. Note that the hotel was valuated in 2022, before the renovation started, for € 937.000,-
All reports, documents, floorplans etc in place! Videotour available on request.
