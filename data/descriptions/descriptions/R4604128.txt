Can you imagine living in a very beautiful chalet in Coín, surrounded by all the comforts, a pool, and spacious grounds, at only half the price of similar properties on the coast? This house offers perfect connectivity, just 30 minutes from Málaga, the airport, and Marbella, with easy access to the highway. Located 10 minutes from the center and schools, and literally a step away from the shopping center, where you find everything you need. The property, tranquil and easily accessible, spans 222 square meters across two floors.

Upon entering the first floor through a beautiful wooden door, a hallway opens up, and the fully equipped rustic kitchen is to the left. Opposite, through the foyer, you'll find a spacious living room and a sunny master bedroom that have access to the large covered terrace with views of the mountains and the pool. Two additional bedrooms and a rustic-style bathroom complete this floor.

The ground floor, accessible through an interior staircase or from the garden, is an incredibly spacious basement with endless possibilities: from turning it into an independent apartment to a game room or cinema. With a equipped kitchen and bar, a full bathroom, a huge laundry room (actually a room), and access to the pool, this space is as versatile as your imagination. From the ground floor, you can access the garden and the pool area. Part of this area is covered and can be used even on rainy or very sunny days. Don't miss the opportunity!
