Wonderful property in one of the most sought after areas of Marbella, the luxurious Puerto Banús, which is home to expensive boutiques, restaurants and bars around the marina. Christian Dior, Gucci, Bvlgari, Versace, Dolce & Gabbana and many more international brands have their luxury stores here. It is also the scene of many exotic cars that are owned by international celebrities and wealthy owners who also own large yachts sitting in the marina.

The property is located in the same marina, a few steps walk from all these amenities and the beach, and has 2 bedrooms, 2 full bathrooms, a spacious living room with access to a terrace with views of the sea and the boats, and a kitchen fully equiped.

Malaga airport is 60 km away. There is a good network of roads and transport services that connect Puerto Banús with neighboring towns and suburbs.

The location of this apartment will delight your stay in Puerto Banús. You will have the opportunity to live the height of this very special enclave of the Costa del Sol with all its
intensity; glamour, fun, modernity and the sea and in the months when the apartment is not used, it can also be used at a profit, due to the great demand for both long and short term rentals.

The best investment ever made!
