Fantastic first line golf unit with open views to the sea from both floors! Large interior with a practical layout. Two terraces, both facing south, allowing a maximum sun exposure. Fully equipped kitchen, with all appliances, and a separate laundry room. It is a corner apartment so very private. The golf course is one of the best in the area, and well maintained all year round. There is a mini market, a cafeteria with tapas, and a wonderful clubhouse with restaurant, all only a couple minutes waking from the property. There are two underground private parking spots, included in the price. A must see!
