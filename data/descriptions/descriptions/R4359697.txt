Plot of walnut trees of almost 5.000 m2 next to the Lagunas de Mijas. It is an agricultural property with electricity and water, it has a quarterly water cost of 150 euros fixed, so with 50 euros per month you have all the necessary water for the farm. On the property there is a house built with 1 bedroom and a very spacious living room, it is registered in the land registry and pays its corresponding IBI, however it does not yet appear in the land registry. The finca is very spacious, with two orchards, a lot of land, storage for tools and the house. It is in a very quiet area but close to everything, very bright. Ideal for a quiet life and to grow one's own natural food, at the moment it is not for development but it seems that in the future it could be requalified. Also they are going to build a series of roads nearby giving much more life to the area but without the noise of the road.
