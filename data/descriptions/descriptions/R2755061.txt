A property that could be your ‘little piece of heaven' with a little imagination this property could be amazing. 

The views are wow, with the outdoor terrace is asking for a chill out seating area. The large master bedroom on the top floor has a walk in wardrobe
This master suite boast fabulous views and crying out for a spacious loft style conversation with large widows framing the mountains.
The lounge runs along the middle floor opening into the kitchen. 

Downstairs is a studio apartment, this also I would suggest need converting to a second bedroom with ensuite or perhaps a ‘Den' office.

Guaro is a modest white village, located on the edge of the Sierra de las Nieves natural park. Thanks to its elevated position, at over 350 metres above sea level, the village offers privileged views across the surrounding countryside.

The area is known for producing almonds and olives, which is an important part of the local economy. Guaro has it ́s own olive mill, where locals have their harvests pressed. It is the ideal spot for outdoor lovers, which also offers a few famous cultural activities like the Luna Mora festival in September. Like many white villages in Andalucia, the village dates back to the Arabic occupation of Spain. 


Guaro is located 55 minutes (50 km) from the city of Málaga and the airport and the beaches of the Costa del Sol (Marbella) are only a 35 minute (24 km.) drive away!
