The Mijas villa is one of 33 contemporary newly built homes. Each one is accessed from the wide communal streets that were built especially for the community
of La Cala, and every villa is reached via automatic private gates that lead onto generous driveways where plenty of parking is found. The villa sits in one of the most privileged locations within the community, at the end of a cul-de-sac, ensuring absolute peace and tranquility. 
The current owners of this particular villa have made several upgrades to the exterior of the property and the 1500 square meter plot and added more bedrooms and ensuite bathrooms.
There is a pathway from the garage and parking spaces that leads behind the villa to the impressive front door. Opening into the open-plan living and dining area, there is an abundance of light thanks to the floor-to-ceiling patio doors which span both adjacent walls of this great living area. The views to the verdant green lawns of the garden and the glistening waters of the pool are simply gorgeous, and the possibility to open all of the patio doors to allow interior and exterior space ensures that the very best al fresco lifestyle can be enjoyed.
The gardens have been beautifully nurtured with additional plants and shrubs around the perimeter, which truly enhance the green lawns surrounding the pool. 
I also has a lounge area with jungle style and cinema room and bar area.
The interior has been done by Be Beautiful interior Design with exquisit decor and also the garden, having been preserved from the original la Cala de Mijas landscape.
We hold the keys to your dream house.
