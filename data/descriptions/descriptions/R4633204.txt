This complete project, featuring an architect-designed villa, comes with a plot ready for construction in just 8 months.

Nestled right after Ojen in Monda, the plot boasts a finca that can be transformed into a stunning villa. The main facade showcases a distinctive tower, adding a unique accent to the property.

Enhancing the entrance is a roundabout for smooth vehicle circulation, leading to a parking area under a protective pergola. The pool area features wooden platforms, a Thai bed, showers, and an outdoor bathroom. The infinity pool with overflowing edges offers a luxurious touch.

The Guincho and barbecue area, adorned with rustic shingle, complements the natural landscape. It includes a dining space, barbecue, wood oven, and a toilet in the public area, while a private en-suite bedroom with a view of the jacuzzi forms the secluded zone.

A Feng Shui garden expands from the master suite, providing tranquility. The terrace with a pergola connects this garden to the master bedroom and its jacuzzi.

The existing arched gallery is covered to create additional indoor space, serving as the main living room with a stone fireplace. The Roman courtyard and original character of Villa Ashe are preserved.

An intimate Chill Out area with mountain views and an outdoor jacuzzi provides a perfect retreat. The entrance hall, at the base of the tower, connects to the office and serves as a distributor for the main area with two en-suite guest bedrooms.

A glass dome-covered living room, bordered by arched galleries resembling a Roman patio, features a central stone fireplace, creating a unique focal point. The kitchen, accessible through sliding glass doors, is adjacent to a glass patio and arch gallery, integrating the villa's natural surroundings.

The master bedroom boasts an en-suite bathroom, dressing room, jacuzzi, and a private terrace. Connected to the central hall and the Feng Shui garden, it offers a serene living experience.

Don't miss this opportunity to own the plot with or without the project. Your dream home awaits.
