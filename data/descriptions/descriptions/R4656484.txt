Rare opportunity to acquire a charming, 1 bedroom apartment in the highly desirable Pueblo del Sol with stunning sea views with opportunity to add a second bedroom. Exclusive listing.

This charming property hidden in the gated Pueblo del Sol enjoys a sunny South orientation to the Mediterranean Sea from its generous sized terrace, which is partly covered. There is ample room for both dining alfresco or enjoying a cool drink with family and friends as well reclining on sun beds, perfect for lounging in the sunshine, both in Summer and in Winter. It's also just a few minutes gentle stroll to the closest amenities – the perfect hideaway in the sun. The property is well maintained, but has the original decor from when the property was constructed.

Pueblo del Sol is a charming, well established, very well maintained, secure gated community.

As you walk along the paths in this charming oasis you notice the gardens throughout have orange, lemon and grapefruit trees bearing generous fruits.
