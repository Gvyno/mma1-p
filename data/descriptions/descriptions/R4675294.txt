Charming one bedroom garden apartment with scope to accommodate guests

This apartment is located in a beachfront complex close to Cancelada. The complex itself has several restaurants, four pools, sporting facilities, grocery shop, hairdressers, chiringuito and more. It is convenient for local transport but also has plenty of parking available. 

Inside, the property is very spacious with a lovely open plan living / dining room and modern kitchen (with fireplace and air conditioning) leading out to an enclosed terrace / sun room which could easily be used as an extra guest bedroom. The master bedroom and bathroom are well proportioned and the bedroom also leads out to the private garden. 

The main garden faces west and is ideally situated for those who enjoy being part of a community. There is also a pretty patio area to the front of the property. 

The apartment is approximately one minute's walk from the largest of the community pools where you will also find a selection of restaurants, and two minutes walk from the beach where you can visit the chiringuito or take a walk along the promenade.
