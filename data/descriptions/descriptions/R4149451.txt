In the beautiful urbanization of Playa Marina del Faro, we find this property that has a privileged location in front of the sea and a great variety of bars, restaurants and shops around it.
The ground floor has a kitchen, living room with fireplace, a toilet and a large terrace from where you can enjoy the incredible sea views, almost as if it were a first line.
On the first floor, there are two bedrooms and a full bathroom to share.
The master bedroom has a charming south-facing enclosed balcony.
This urbanisation has two beautiful swimming pools and very well kept garden areas.

As it is close to the motorway, the noise from the road can be heard a little.

Within a few steps to the beach and amenities. A  5 minute drive to La Cala de Mijas and Fuengirola.
