Superb 3 bedroom semi-detached house in a well established complex in the area of Mijas Golf. This property really stands out with its unique features that give you a true sense of space. On entry you will find the fully fitted kitchen and utility room, split level dining area and lounge and a private south facing terrace.   On the upper levels you will find another sunny terrace and 3 generous sized bedrooms all with fitted wardrobes with two sharing a shower room and the main bedroom has its own renovated en-suite bathroom. Bright, airy and full of character in this typically Andalusian style home complete with an internal atrium allowing natural light to flow through the house. The, soon to be gated, community is beautifully maintained with a large communal swimming pool.  The popular Fuengirola and La Cala beaches are less than 10 minutes by car or public transport and Malaga airport is an easy 30 minutes drive. Surrounded by the prestigious Mijas Golf courses of Los Lagos and Los Olivos, this is a property that you have to see. Excellent value with all the trimmings and more.
