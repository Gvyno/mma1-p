Located in one of the most exclusive residential enclaves in Europe, this 2772 m2 plot in the Kings & Queens area of Sotogrande (Cadiz - Spain) is a unique opportunity to build the residence of your dreams.
The project that we are marketing together with the plot, and the corresponding building permit obtained in August 2023, has been designed by an elite team that combines the work of the prestigious architectural studio OOAA, the interior design of Luisa Olazabal and the landscaping of Jesús Gómez.
The residence, known as VILLA SANTIAGO, uses symmetries, courtyards and classical rhythms, combined with contemporary spaces and cutting-edge technology, such as pocket windows that connect the interior and exterior, transforming the spaces into porches.
Its privileged location places it close to dream beaches and the prestigious Real Club de Golf Sotogrande, providing a lifestyle full of leisure and recreational options. Furthermore, its accessibility by bicycle is remarkable thanks to the absence of steep slopes on the road, allowing for relaxed strolls in the surrounding area.
The Villa Santiago project offers a single-storey layout, designed for comfort and functionality. With a total of 6 bedrooms with en-suite bathrooms, the property offers the flexibility to include a separate guest house, with 2 additional bedrooms and 2 bathrooms, perfect for entertaining family or friends in a comfortable and private manner. The design integrates three outdoor living areas, a glass-walled paddle tennis court, a swimming pool, a rooftop lounge area, a built-in barbecue in the courtyard, a yoga platform, an outdoor gym and several outdoor showers.
