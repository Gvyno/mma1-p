Lovely Semi detached town house in Jarales de Calahonda. Walking distance to everything, shops, bars, restaurants, bus stops, beach etc etc. 20 minutes to Malaga airport. Really is a great location! Set in a well kept, secure urbanisation with swimming pool, fountains and mature gardens. The house itself has been well kept. Bright and spacious with lounge dinner, cozy fire place and enclosed patio area that can be used all year round.
Kitchen is modern and in a great condition. Upstairs are three bedrooms, one of which is ensuite and with a little balcony. Great house for a family of holiday home. Really is a must see.
