Beautiful little house with a lot of character, Ibizan style in the old town of Marbella.
It is located in one of the most beautiful streets in the old town and super quiet.
It is distributed over two floors, on the main floor we find a cozy living room next to a beautiful patio covered by a system of electric sliding windows on the roof, giving you the possibility of opening it or leaving it completely closed depending on the weather.
There is also a small but fully equipped kitchen with a window to the outside street.
Through a beautiful iron staircase from the beginning of the century, you go up to the upper floor where there are two bedrooms and a bathroom with a shower, both bedrooms with wardrobes and windows to the outside.
The house is in a perfect state of conservation, ready to move in.

A truly recommended property to visit.
