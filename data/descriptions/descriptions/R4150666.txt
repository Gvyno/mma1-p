Villa Hibisco is ideally located in the residential area of Nueva Andalucia in a private and secure community in Marbella Country Club. When entering the property, the pool area is found in front of the house.

A more private exterior space, perfect for al fresco dinning with its own outdoor kitchen is found at the back of the villa. On ground level, you will find an open plan solution, strategically over different levels in order to separate the dinning and kitchen areas from the living space. It&#039;s a 4 bedroom, 3,5 bath villa with 4 terraces over two levels as well as a separate laundry room in the backyard and a garage.

The developers paid great attention to detail, therefore the property comes fully furnished including bathrobes, towels and glasses with Villa Hibisco logo. This is a key ready house.
