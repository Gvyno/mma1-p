Charming Spanish farm only 10 minutes from Fuengirola city centre. The house is in perfect shape and is composed of three bedrooms one bathroom. The large living room with its colonial style has a fireplace. The kitchen is large enough to room a large family. Beside the kitchen is a large garage that has been adopted as a party spot.

The plot is almost 3000m2 with a few fruit trees. This house could be easily used as a private kindergarten for its proximity to the towns and the English international school. This, of course, depends on permissions from the local authorities. The farm has enough flat plot around the house to serve as a playground.
