Nice flat in the centre of Fuengirola, 50 metres from the beach, spacious living-dining room, independent kitchen, 2 bedrooms, one with built-in wardrobe and one with dressing room, 2 bathrooms (one en suite), balcony. Very luminous, building constructed in 2004, it is located in a dead end street so it is very quiet. Perfect to live in or as an investment.
