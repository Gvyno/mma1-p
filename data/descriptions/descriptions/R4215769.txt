MARBELLA center, near the beach.
Modern and completely renovated apartment with great taste and quality, in one of the areas with the most social and tourist activity in Marbella, next to La Fontanilla, surrounded by shops and a few streets from the beach. The property has three bedrooms and two bathrooms.
Located on the seventh floor of an emblematic building, thanks to the height, the views are magnificent to the mountains and partial to the sea from the living room and the fully equipped kitchen. La Concha can be seen impressively from the main bedroom suite.
Because it is in an area with all the services available and a wide variety of restaurants, without forgetting that the beach is just a few meters away, it is a property with the possibility of vacation rental providing very good profitability if what the new owner wants is to invest for rent.
15,000€ more if you wish to purchase the property furnished
