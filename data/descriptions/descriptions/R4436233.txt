Three bedroom, two bathroom top floor apartment - newly renovated throughout.

This apartment has been entirely modernised inside with brand new kitchen, bathrooms, floors, windows, roof access, aircon, water heater and so much more. It is presented as a blank canvas, with no furniture, for a new owner to make their mark and decorate to their own taste. 

Located in a prime residential area of El Paraiso, the apartment is walking distance to golf, tennis, shops, restaurants, offices, bank, pharmacy, hair dressers and so on. The beach is approximately a 10 to 15 minute walk away via a footbridge. There are also some larger supermarkets within 20 minutes walk or a two minute drive. 

One of the best features of this apartment is that it is easy to access with no steps from one of the communal parking areas - despite it being on the top floor. It has its own private roof terrace accessed via steps inside the apartment and a hatch style opening. From the living room and the roof terrace you can enjoy wonderfully calming views across the community gardens, countryside and with a glimpse of the Mediterranean beyond. 

The complex has recently approved the construction of a new swimming pool which they hope to be able to open in Summer 2024.
