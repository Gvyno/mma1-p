Detached villa in a quiet area, close to all shops, restaurants, and just a few meters walk to the beach. The villa is built on a single floor with two solariums and features 4 bedrooms, 3 bathrooms, a guest apartment, a living room with a fireplace, a kitchen with a breakfast area, stunning sea views, a closed garage, air conditioning (hot/cold) in the living room and master bedroom, a spacious storage room, solar panels, beautiful gardens, a pool with a jacuzzi, and many more extras.

The house is very spacious, bright, and sunny. As it requires some renovations, there is plenty of potential to make fabulous changes and take advantage of all the space available.
