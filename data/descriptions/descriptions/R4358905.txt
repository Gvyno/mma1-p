Great investment opportunity in the area of Riviera del Sol.

The house has a constructed area of 356 m2, on 4 floors with the possibility to install a lift, consisting of 3 bedrooms, 2 of them with en-suite bathrooms, with their respective dressing rooms, kitchen, living-dining room with access to one of the 3 terraces of the property, 1 patio and a large studio on the ground floor, with independent access.
Thanks to its layout and openings to the outside, this characterful house offers a pleasant brightness without losing its coolness in summer, and the roof terrace, often the hallmark of a contemporary house, provides a haven of peace and an unobstructed view for cosy evenings all year round. SR1
