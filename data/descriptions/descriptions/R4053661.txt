Cosy Spanish townhouse in Benahavís village.

Located in El Valle de Guadalmina only a short walk from all the amenities and services in the village.

This home consists of 2 levels plus a practical rooftop solarium. As you enter the entrance hall leads to the living room, guest toilet or the stairway.

The living room is of a good size and it goes from the front of the house to the back. Next to the dining area, we find a fully fitted kitchen with a nice window that faces a covered patio which gives many possibilities and has access to the west-facing private garden of this property.
The higher level presents 3 good size bedrooms with fitted wardrobes and 2 bathrooms, being the main en-suite and with access to a small terrace covered nowadays, with a spiral staircase that leads to the roof-top solarium that offers views in every direction and sun all day.

The community offers all the neighbours access to a very good size pool surrounded by a nice garden next to a paddle-ball court.
