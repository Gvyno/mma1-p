Villa with exceptional views near Gaucín, Costa del Sol, this remarkable country house sprawls across a 34,000m2 plot offering uninterrupted vistas of Gibraltar and North Africa. Boasting over 600m2 of living space, this newly constructed property comprises eight separate bedrooms.

Inspired by the majestic temple of Isis in Upper Egypt, the main house features dual living rooms, dining spaces, kitchens, and ensuite bedrooms. Three distinct south-facing terraces invite the outdoors in. The basement encompasses a service area, ample storage, and utilities like a water tank, solar hot water system, and dual boilers for heating and hot water. With gas central heating, double-glazed windows, air conditioning, satellite TV, and a pool purified by natural salt, comfort and luxury intertwine seamlessly.

A separate guest house offers a reception area, lounge, dining room, and a terrace embracing the southern sun. Two guest bathrooms complement six bedrooms, each with private terraces. An expansive swimming pool and generous sunbathing zone add allure, surrounded by sprawling terraces ideal for gatherings and enjoying panoramic views.

The property&#039;s southern edge hosts a tranquil stream while concealed electrical wiring enhances the landscape. The estate includes a dual drainage system—septic and garden-based—for environmental sustainability, set amidst an olive tree-dotted landscape. Connected to a community water supply, this magnificent villa sits a mere 40 minutes from Sotogrande and just an hour and a half from Malaga and its international airport.
