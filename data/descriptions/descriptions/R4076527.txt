We are very proud to introduce to you this unique 5* off plan villa, nestled within the heart of this well established urbanisation.

This price is for the completed Key in Hand Villa

Distributed over 3 floors with a unique roof-top infinity pool, the owners of this home will be able to enjoy a peaceful lifestyle surrounded by nature and be privileged to spectacular rooftop views spanning the coastline of Mijas Costa.
The elegant villa design perfectly encapsulates the mediterranean lifestyle and creates a harmony with its natural surroundings. Open interiors merge seamlessly with ample terraces on each level providing plenty of relaxation areas. The house itself will be built to the highest of standards utilising an assortment of natural finishings. The new owners are able to personalise the internal distribution should they wish. They can work with the project manager to put their own stamp on what can only be described as a work of art.

Current plans are for 4 bedrooms, 5 bathrooms (4 of which are ensuite), and a large 100m2 basement to be utilised to your desire, games room, gym, additional bedrooms, office space or all of above.

Works can start almost immediately with the license that is in place and the build should take around 13 months, although the contract will be for 15 months to account for any unforeseen circumstances.
Campo Mijas and its surrounding areas seem to be enjoying a massive uplift in value with the current boom in the Spanish property market. Decent real estate in the area doesn't stay on the market for very long.

A flexible payment schedule can be arrange between the new owners and the project manager.

Please don't hesitate to get in touch for more information and viewings…….this opportunity will not be on the market for very long.
