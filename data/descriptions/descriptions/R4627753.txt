Fabulous urban plot of 694 m2 with sea views.
It has a buildable area of 27% up to two floors plus basement, with an excellent south orientation and sea views.
The plot is practically flat except for the southeast side, which is vertical.

It is located in a quiet area of Torreblanca and with all services just a couple of minutes away by car.

Ideal to buy a chalet and enjoy one of the most sought-after areas of Fuengirola.
