This is an exceptional front line beach property when only real beach front is good enough. This mature gated complex has a whole range of onsite facilities proving a very social atmosphere with a beachside pool, bar and restaurant, tennis courts among other facilities. What really makes this property special is the direct access to the beach and the amazingly popular new beach walk which has improved Calahonda as an area by linking all the beaches and allowing one to go jogging or walking for KMS along the great coastline.
