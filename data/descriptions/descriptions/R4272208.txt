Lovely Villa with 6 guest apartments, breath-taking views and only 3 minutes to Estepona.
High Rental potential and a great place to be!
Located in LOS REALES close to Sierra Bermeja National Park, upon a quiet hill southwest facing with breath-taking panoramic views to the Mediterranean, the mountains, Estepona and even to Gibraltar and the African Coastline! 
A fantastic 7-bedroom villa with a heated swimming pool, a double garage and totally private, very maintained garden with its own well, a fifty thousand litre water tank, solar heating for water, pool and spa, many orange and other fruit trees and garden lights. The Andalusian style villa is of solid quality and offers light-flooded rooms, 6 guest apartments with own living room and bathroom and brand new aircon h/c. A big open kitchen and dining/living area, lots of terraces with stunning views and totally privacy! 
All this just a 3 km drive to the beautiful beaches of flower garden city Estepona with all the great restaurants and amenities and less than 10 minutes' drive to San Pedro and Marbella.
This very private property could be interesting for someone who is looking for short term rentals (the tourist licence is for 20 persons), or the combination of living and business at the same place. 
Viewings highly recommend.
