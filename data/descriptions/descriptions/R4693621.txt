A 2 bedroom 1 bathroom ground florr apartment at La Duquesa

The property has views only to the urbanization.

The Urbanization was finished in 2007 but still pending to get the LPO, hence the bargain price of the property.
The LPO is now only missing the relevant final inspection and cleaning of the water supply pipelines to the Urbanization.

Priced to sell quickly
