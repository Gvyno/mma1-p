We are pleased to offer you this beautiful ground floor, in a Mediterranean-style residential community, private and located a few minutes from Manilva beach.
A very quiet and well-kept area, ideal for families with children or as a holiday residence.
The house has a total of 120 Sq m built and another 50 Sq m of terrace facing Southeast, which provides plenty of light and guarantees many hours of sun.
Large living room with access to it, spacious independent and fully equipped kitchen, 5 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. It also has a private underground garage.
The house can be accessed through 2 entrances, either through the main one or through the other side, through the terrace, since it communicates with the community spaces through a gate.
The community has several swimming pools and each building has only 3 floors, so there are not too many neighbors. If you want to know more about this property, call us without obligation.
