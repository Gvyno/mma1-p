Presenting a wonderful ground floor home with four spacious bedrooms, each with its own bathroom, just 80 meters from Elviria&#039;s beautiful white beach! This home is in Golden Beach, a lovely place with tropical gardens, two pools for adults, two for kids, cute bridges, and waterfalls that lead right to the beach.

Inside, you&#039;ll find big bedrooms with attached bathrooms, a kitchen that&#039;s open to the living area, and a nice terrace all around the apartment with views of the area. There&#039;s even a Jacuzzi! Everything is newly renovated and comes with all the furniture you see.

The location is fantastic, with lots of great stuff nearby. You&#039;ve got two Beach Clubs – La Plage Casanis and Estrella del Mar – where you can enjoy music, drinks, and sunbeds. There&#039;s also Vincci Seleccion, a fancy five-star hotel with a spa and gym. Plus, you&#039;ll find plenty of restaurants and grocery stores just a short walk away. Parking is easy in the association&#039;s parking lot.
