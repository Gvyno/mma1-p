A fantastic centrally located modern 4 bedroom apartment.  When we say centrally located, we really do mean central. Located in the very heart of Marbella with a prestigious Ricardo Soriano address. 
This 4 bedroom 4 bathroom apartment recently refurbished to a very high standard with all bedrooms enjoying their own ensuite bathrooms.  A high quality lounge / loft style front room with panoramic views of Ricardo Soriano.  The Kitchen is high spec, modern and stylish with a seperate laundry room.  

This property has had no expense spared and really is a stunning property in a location that is simple no longer available. 

Marbella Town Center enjoys everything one can wish for, some of the best food and beverage venue around whilst also offering a great family location with schools and parks on the door step.
