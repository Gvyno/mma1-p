Charming rustic villa surrounded by the Guadalmina Golf course. This comfortable family home is very stylish and bright. The property is built on 2 levels, which offers 4 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms, kitchen and open living/dining room with large picture windows on either side of the room making the most of the surrounding nature and golf views. A beautiful large working fireplace is the focal point of the living room, high ceiling with wooden beams and doors leading out onto a covered terrace/dining room. Large garden with private heated pool and Jacuzzi. The house has drains to avoid humidity. Alarm in the garden area and house separately. The views of the rooms all overlook the pool and the garden. From the living room we can access a large terrace with barbecue and deck. Parking space inside the villa for up to 4 cars. Great property with a lot of charm and potential, built on a spacious plot. An ideal holiday hideaway only a few minutes' drives from all amenities or as a very private permanent residence in the heart of the golf area of Guadalmina and San Pedro.
