Wonderful beachfront corner ground floor apartment with a private garage! 

Thanks to its unique position, this property is sunk in natural light throughout the entire day. It has 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms, a kitchen, an entrance hall and a huge living and dining room with a fireplace, which will make your winters warm and cozy. The apartment also possesses a spacious terrace and a private garden.

Located in one of the best residences of San Pedro, besides its beachfront position, it is also just a step away from all the amenities and services of the area. The apartment has a huge potential both as a holiday home and permanent residence, and has a supreme location, so it won't stay on the market for long!
