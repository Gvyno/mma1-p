Large renovated duplex apartment with amazing seaview!

As you enter, this home feels more like a townhouse than apartment because you have your very own, gated patio entrance. It offers 3 bedrooms (2 ensuite) and 3 bathrooms. There is also an already approved license to close one of the side terraces and make an extra room/office/storage. The master bedroom is large with a terrace, walk in closet, bathroom and makeup area. The terrace is shared with one of the other bedrooms, which is also en-suite.

It has a very big open plan livingroom/kitchen with breathtaking view and access to the second terrace with barbeque and outdoor shower.

Central heating hot/cold with 3 zones. Drinkable water.

Large home, very suitable for permanent living or holiday. The property used to be 2 seperate apartments but has been turned in to one large unit. Located within a small gated community of only 34 apartments. Community pool is fairly new, it was built in 2019 and offers amazing views all the way to Gibraltar and Africa. Less than 1km to the closest commercial center and only a few minutes drive to the beaches of San Pedro and Puerto Banus. Several golf courses around (La Quinta, La Zagaleta, Los Arqueros etc).
