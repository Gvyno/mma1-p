Situated in a prestige urbanization just on the outskirts of Coin, close to main supermarkets, bars, restaurants and a pharmacy, this modern 3 bedroom townhouse is newly built to very high specifications and has not yet been lived in. 

Entering the house up the marble steps, there is a bathroom with shower to the right, a large kitchen with completely tiled walls, water and electrical points just waiting for you to install you new kitchen. French windows with security shutters lead to an interior patio.
From the hallway, a sliding door leads to a large lounge which also has French windows with security shutters that also lead to the interior patio.

Going up the marble stairs with chrome banisters, the second floor is as light and airy as the ground floor. The hallway leads to 3 good sized bedrooms, one with its own terrace and the other with chrome and glass Juliette balcony, a separate terrace where water connections are for a washing machine and a full bathroom with bath.

This townhouse has the pre-installation for air conditioning, solar panels for hot water, doble glazed widows, electric shutters and an ample underground parking/basement area with water deposits.

Must be seen to be appreciated.
