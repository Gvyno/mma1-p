Bright and sunny bungalow on large plot with building license for a brand new villa.

The property is situated in a quiet cul-de-sac in Elviria on a plot of just under 2.000 square meters and has a total constructed area over 400 square meters. The bungalow itself offers 4 bedrooms with 2 bathrooms, guest toilet, an ample lounge with natural fireplace, a fully fitted kitchen and a great patio with spectacular sea-views. Next to the bungalow is an additional independent guest house with 2 bedrooms, bathroom, lounge, kitchen and a small terrace. A double garage as well as a large storage area that can be converted into another guest house is located in the same building. 

The private swimming pool is accessible from both the main house and the guest house. The big garden has been totally cleaned by the current owner in preparation for the construction of the new villa and 250 plants have been planted around the whole plot to create a natural property boundary with maximum privacy. The property is conveniently situated, easily accessible from the Elviria exit and just 10 minutes from Marbella center and 30 minutes from Malaga airport. 

The building license for a brand new villa has been applied for in May 2022 and is expected to be granted very soon. The spectacular villa has a total of 775 m2 built area with a great design. The existing bungalow is perfect to live in or rent out as it is, but would benefit from a little update if this would be for the long term. A unique property in a desirable location with license to construct a brand new villa, which makes it perfect for home owners as well as investors.
