EXCLUSIVE! Two commercial locals turned into an exclusive restaurant in Puerto Banus, right next to the El Corte Ingles shopping centre, in the Cristamar centre. Includes a large covered terrace and a fully equipped kitchen. Parking in the same street or underground public parking.  It is a working restaurant at the moment with a monthly rental of 4085€. The restaurant business is not for sale, only the locals, so it's a very good opportunity for an investor.
