Charming four bedroom villa available in La Sierrezuela.
This unique property is initially unassuming but it will surprise you. On the main floor, upon entering the property you will find the kitchen, the large lounge, with a fireplace, and dining room as well as the main bedroom with an ensuite bathroom. Wrapping around the front half of the property is a terrace which you can access from both the bedroom and the lounge. It overlooks the large garden and swimming pool and is spacious enough to enjoy as an outside leisure or dining space. 
From this main floor you can go downstairs to the lower level where you will find the remaining 3 bedrooms. There is also another kitchen and small lounge/dining area. This level will also lead out onto a terrace that boasts a built-in barbecue, a large entertaining area and direct access to the pool, jacuzzi and garden. 
The property has A/C installed and has a successful rental history. It is close to amenities, including restaurants shops and bars, yet is still located in a very quiet and peaceful area. 
The property benefits from a location and positioning that allows for almost complete privacy.
