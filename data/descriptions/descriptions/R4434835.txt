Excellent opportunity to sell an apartment in the beautiful Mirador del Mar urbanization, located in Bahía de Casares, a few minutes from Estepona and close to Manilva.

Key features of the apartment are as follows:

- Footage: 95 square meters of housing plus a generous 80 square meter terrace.
- Distribution: Two bedrooms, two full bathrooms with bathtub, a large living room with fireplace, a spacious fully equipped kitchen and a small laundry room.
- Amenities: The property has a parking space a few meters from the apartment and has two community pools, one of them intended for CHILDREN.
 It is important to note that the apartment will be delivered unfurnished (including pergola on the terrace that belongs to the tenant), except for the kitchen, which is fully equipped. All bedrooms have fitted wardrobes and there are additional fitted wardrobes in the hallway for further storage.

The apartment has been an excellent investment in the rental market, with a current rent of 950 euros plus expenses. If a client is interested in acquiring the property for rental investment purposes, it is possible to obtain a higher rent, taking into account that the current price is unfurnished.
