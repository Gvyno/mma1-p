Spacious and bright apartment with 4 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms in the center of Marbella. South orientation .
With a nice terrace with beautiful views.

The apartment is sold with a private covered parking space. A 2 minute walk to the beach and all the amenities on your doorstep make this a very attractive vacation home, as well as year round living.
Highly recommended to see.
