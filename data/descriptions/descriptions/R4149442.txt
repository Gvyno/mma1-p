Located in the beautiful marina of Cabopino, Marbella, within the cobbled 'plaza/square'. This spacious and incredibly popular bar / restaurant is a golden investment opportunity in terms of real estate and income.  With fabulous summer month trade and steady winter trade from locals and golfers, this property consists of a large bar area, split-level interior seating areas, ladies and gentleman's bathrooms plus a very large refurbished kitchen.  Seating capacity over 90.

Plus the stunning outside terrace which runs the full length of the internal space, offering shaded and sunny areas for clientele to sit and enjoy the lovely view over the gardens and busy square. 
This bar / restaurant is currently only open from 5pm until late in the evening and has been running profitably for over 20 years.

The business can be opened for lunch as well to increase its revenues substantially, but the owner wishes to retire and not work those longer hours. Priced to sell quickly.
