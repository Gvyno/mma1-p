Great opportunity to purchase spacious home for your family in good, centric location but yet quiet area. This three bedroom home come with large storage room AND underground garage place so life can not be more easy. It is first floor but around 8 meters from the ground. This corner unit is spacious and has and large glazed terrace towards west. Kitchen has really nice open views so cooking is even more fun here. There is some work to be done, nothing major, but painting and som fixing and it has been taken into account when setting the price. Ten minute walk from the beach, from the Swedish school, 15 min walk from the Finnish school and all possible services are just out the door. Do come to visit, this is really worth it!
