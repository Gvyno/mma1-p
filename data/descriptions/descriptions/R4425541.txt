PRICED TO SELL. MOTIVATED VENDOR 'Thou shalt have no other penthouses before me', as the good book says and this is just one of those penthouses that ticks all your boxes. More secure than Fort Knox, if you ask me.  In addition this is a penthouse per definition. An elevator with direct access to the apartment and yes, you are the one and only resident on this floor. 
The views are beyond belief, to put it mildly. No picture can do them justice, so they need to be admired on site. The communal areas are in immaculate condition and the penthouse itself is no exception.  The terrace, oh that terrace does not only offer you the best views you can imagine. It is south orientated so you get plenty of sun, but it is also partially covered, which you will appreciate in July and August. Let´s not forget the terrace bar where you can serve yourself a cool drink and it´s conveniently placed close to the jacuzzi, which is only a few steps away. Two parking spaces and a storage unit are included as well. 
I can go on and on about this property but I will let the pictures and the video speak for themselves. Should you be interested in the real experience though, contact us today to arrange a viewing. You will NOT be disappointed.
