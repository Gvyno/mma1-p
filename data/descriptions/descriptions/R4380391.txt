Wonderful semi-detached villa located 300 m from the Miramar Shopping Centre and 900 m from the beach, in an excellent area with mountain views. Around it you can find all kinds of shops, supermarkets, bus, school and a few meters from the A7 motorway where you can connect to Malaga or Marbella in 20 min. The construction of the area and its location make this area very quiet without noise. It also has its own parking space, but it is also very easy to park in the street.
