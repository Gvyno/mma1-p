Swedish/Scandinavian grocery store for sale, rent or lease in Marbella, Spain.
Will consider offers.

 A very nicely decorated grocery store on Spain's most popular part of the sunny coast, Marbella.  

 A fantastic opportunity to buy/rent/lease an established Swedish grocery store in a good location in eastern Marbella which has nearby high end developments with plenty of parking. It's  more than 180m2 , good client base with 5 minutes walk to the beach.

 A new luxury residential area is being built right next door, Dunique,
 which will contribute to an even larger clientele for Norrlands.  Because of that, the whole area is being lifted to another level.

 There is also a long lease agreement (10 year contract) with very favorable rent as it was signed at the end of the Covid period and just before the construction plans of Dunique was finished.

 It is the perfect purchase for those who want to establish themselves in Marbella and have thought about starting their own business or finding new employment.
