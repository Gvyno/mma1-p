Situated in the foothills of the mountain, in a quiet urbanization, with views of the Mijas countryside and the sea in the background, the house is divided into two parts that separate the main house from the area of additional bedrooms or guest rooms.
It has two floors over a garage located at street level, and an interesting play of levels and double heights with sloping ceilings that enriches the relationships between the rooms, and provides a warm and welcoming living space thanks to the different natural light that enters the house.
Mediterranean in style, but with a contemporary feel, it combines the vernacular aesthetics of the area with the comforts of modern life. Located in a privileged enclave just 5 minutes from Mijas, 15 minutes from Alhaurín el Grande or 30 minutes from Marbella and Malaga international airport.
