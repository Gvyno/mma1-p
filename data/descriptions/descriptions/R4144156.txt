'My home is my castle', they say and this is definitely no exception. This is a beautiful freehold penthouse with a bull´s eye location in the heart of the marina, offering three bedrooms and three bathrooms (two en suite) not to forget the walk in closets in plural. You also get to enjoy two large terraces facing opposite directions. The main terrace facing the marina and the open sea, offers unobstructed panoramic views, and no Sir/Madam you are not overlooked by anyone. The other terrace has an elevated jacuzzi. Just imagine those pleasant summer nights in that tub with a glass of Cava in your hand. 
Being in the centre of things, comes with certain privileges. You are very close to everything Sotogrande has to offer in the shape of restaurants, bars, shops and last but not least the Saturday market.
In addition ,oh yes there are additions - three underground parking spaces and one storage unit are included in the price. 

Ladies and gentlemen, this is quality of life per definition and maybe best of all - it can be yours.
