You have to see it, to get a good understanding of the possibilities. Once, this building served as a carpentry. Aside from the warehouse areas, there are 2 large apartments and plenty of outside space to create a sundeck at the rear of the building.

One of the apartments could use some modernisation, and offers 3 bedrooms next to a large fitted kitchen, a living room and a bathroom. The other one is currently a shell, that could be developed according to personal wishes. Like te rest of the building. 

The location is very easily accessible! Located just a few steps away from the main road that crosses the village, the busstop, local shops, bars and restaurants. 

Guaro is a modest white village, located on the edge of the Sierra de las Nieves natural park. Thanks to its elevated position, at over 350 metres above sea level, the village offers privileged views across the surrounding countryside.

The area is known for producing almonds and olives, which is an important part of the local economy. Guaro has it ́s own olive mill, where locals have their harvests pressed. It is the ideal spot for outdoor lovers, which also offers a few famous cultural activities like the Luna Mora festival in September. Like many white villages in Andalucia, the village dates back to the Arabic occupation of Spain. 


Guaro is located 55 minutes (50 km) from the city of Málaga and the airport and the beaches of the Costa del Sol (Marbella) are only a 35 minute (24 km.) drive away!
