Situated just a short walk from the sea and the beautiful Guadalmansa area of the New Golden Mile, halfway between Marbella and Estepona, lies this very spacious townhouse. You enter the house into a hall with the new fully fitted open plan kitchen and laundry room on your left, proceed into the living/dining room which in turn leads out to the terrace overlooking one of the community swimming pools, to which you have direct access from the terrace. The first floor consists of two bedroom suites including the master. The upper level has the third & fourth bedroom & bathroom from which you can also access balconies. The house also has a huge basement area plus a large two car private garage. This property would make a great family home or indeed a large holiday home with great rental potential due to its location so close to both the sea and various restaurants and bars close by.
