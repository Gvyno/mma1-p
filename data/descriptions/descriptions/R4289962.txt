Super nice penthouse with a fantastic view over the Mediterranean Sea and the countryside. Located in a nice place, with lovely common areas with a large pool area plus a smaller pool for the children. There is also a large area for shared parking where it is possible to park just below the building.
The apartment consists of two bedrooms, one of which has access to a small terrace with lovely morning sun. Large living room and dining room with fireplace and direct access to the lovely terrace with the fantastic view. Nice and reasonably large kitchen, very well-functioning. Truly an apartment that should be seen.
