Comfortable apartment in one of the most popular complexes in Benahavís village.

Las Mozas is a small community located close to the entrance of Benahavís, was built with great qualities, offering apartments with a nice communal pool and gardens, car park spaces, and storage rooms. Easy access to the village but at the same time in a quiet place away from the noise of bars and restaurants.

This home consists of two bedrooms and two bathrooms, a good size kitchen, that could be open to the living/dining room where you can enjoy a cozy afternoon next to its fireplace. There is as well a good size terrace with a built-in barbeque and stunning views over the park Torre Leonera of the mountains on Benahavís and the gorge of the Guadalmina River. Next to the entrance, there is a guest toilet, which makes the bathrooms a lot more private when visitors come to your home, and next to the kitchen a separate laundry room.

The apartment is orientated to the east at the front with the terrace and you have plenty of natural coming in from the back, that faces west, every evening.

This property includes, like every apartment in Las Mozas a car park space on the underground level and a storage room.

Great rental potential due to its idyllic location.
