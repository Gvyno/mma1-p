Picture an enchanting ground floor apartment, enveloped in luxury, nestled in the idyllic Arenal Golf Phase 1 urbanization in Benalmádena. Here, the hustle and bustle of daily life fade away, making room for an oasis of space and comfort.

Within the walls of this 122 sqm apartment unfolds a majestic view of lush greenery. Three lavish bedrooms extend, one accompanied by a private bathroom. The inviting living-dining room beckons to cozy gatherings, while the separate kitchen opens a door to the terrace, where all this beauty converges.

But the true magic reveals itself as you step into the recently transformed open-plan basement, now an additional living space of 106 sqm. A sanctuary for large families and groups of friends, featuring three more spacious bedrooms, an additional bathroom, and a multifunctional dining area that transforms into a snug sitting area. And then, as the outdoor enthusiast in you awakens, the expansive terrace of 138 sqm lures with its breathtaking views and the gentle breeze of the Mediterranean climate.

For golf enthusiasts, storage space is no concern, as a convenient storage room in the basement of 4x3.5 sqm provides a safe haven for golf bags, a perfect complement given the proximity of three golf courses around the corner. As the cherry on top, there are two parking spaces, one sheltered and one under the radiant sun.

The urbanization embraces its residents with a holiday feel: two refreshing swimming pools for sultry summer days, two paddle tennis courts for the active ones, and expansive gardens to relax and connect with nature. With a quick escape route to the highway, proximity to the airport, and the delights of hospitals, supermarkets, pharmacies, and bus stops within reach, this apartment promises not just space and comfort but a complete lifestyle.
