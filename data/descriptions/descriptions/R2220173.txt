Two building plots, joint together, located in the prestigious and very well maintained urbanisation of Valtocado, situated only a five minutes drive from Mijas Pueblo. Facing South, it comes with excellent views overlooking the countryside and coastline. On each plot, 13% can be built and on maximum 2 stories (7m high), all together around 650m2 available for building. A great opportunity in a very peaceful and natural environment!
