We are delighted to introduce this recently refurbished townhouse in El Naranjal. El Naranjal is one of the most charming residential developments of Nueva Andalucía, Marbella. The character is evident from the moment you enter the urbanization. Capturing the feel of authentic Spain with its cobbled streets, bright orange trees. The individuality of the townhouses couples with the excellent location of the properties make El Naranjal an ideal base for Mediterranean living. This property is ready to move in and offers a good investment opportunity if you are looking for a short rental property or residential home.

This is a 2-bedroom townhouse. Fully fitted kitchen, guest toilet, living and dining room with cozy fireplace and access to the private Spanish patio. On the upper level you will find 2 tastefully presented bedrooms and 2 bathrooms.

The townhouse is situated in a privileged location within the Nueva Andalucia area. Situated only a few minutes away from Puerto Banus and the beach. It is also within walking distance to restaurants in Nueva Andalucía. Everything you could want is close by – restaurants, shops, bars, international schools, supermarkets etc… If you are a golf lover, the development almost backs on to the Aloha Golf, Las Brisas Golf course and Los Naranjos golf club. Just another added bonus!

El Naranjal features matured gardens, large swimming pool and tennis court.
