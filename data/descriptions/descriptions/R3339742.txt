LOMAS DE MIJAS ( 5 min from Mijas Pueblo and about 15 min from Fuengirola beaches)
Rare opportunity to purchase a residential plot in a popular Las Lomas de Mijas urbanization close to Mijas town. Easy access, excellent panoramic and sea views. There is a project that was approved a few years ago  by the Town Hall to build a 3 level villa. The plot is 1600 sq m. Permission to build 41%, AIS-4. T
Note: The plot is quite steep but with really nice views
The new owner will need to apply for a building license.
