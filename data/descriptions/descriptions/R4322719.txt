Charming townhouse in the centre of Benahavís village.

This home enjoys a kitchen/dining room separated from the living which boasts a fantastic fireplace for those winter evenings. From the dining area, we find a steel spiral staircase that connects the three levels of this lovely house, leading us to the bedroom level with one bathroom to share. Both bedrooms have a good size and straight views of the charming streets of the centre.

On the top level, this property offers some storage space, which could be used as an office as well, a laundry area and a sunny rooftop solarium that looks over the village to the mountains surrounding Benahavís.

This cosy and unique property is located with most of the facilities of Benahavís right at your doorstep.
