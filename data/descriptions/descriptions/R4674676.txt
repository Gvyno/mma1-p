An extraordinary opportunity awaits the discerning client who values a timeless aesthetic for their villa. This exquisite home, marked by its traditional charm, demands careful consideration.

The current owners have spared no expense in elevating the property to an impeccable standard, incorporating a diverse range of enhancements. From the moment you step through the attractive front door into the expansive and well-lit entrance hall, it becomes evident that this residence has been meticulously cared for.

The primary lounge, seamlessly connected to the entrance hall, offers a preview of the breathtaking views that await. For added privacy, the lounge can be enclosed by two sliding doors, enhancing the overall sense of seclusion.

This generously proportioned lounge is not only inviting but also thoughtfully designed for shared moments. Adorned with recessed lighting and an appealing fireplace, it serves as a welcoming space. The expansive terrace, directly accessible from the lounge, provides a vantage point overlooking the impressive pool, chic chill-out areas, and offers picturesque views of the lake and mountains.

Adjacent to the lounge, the dining room has been meticulously crafted for enjoyment with friends and family, bathed in glorious natural light. This space reflects a commitment to both style and functionality, creating an ideal setting for memorable gatherings.

Beyond the entrance hall, a convenient guest toilet precedes a brief passageway that leads to the spacious family-sized kitchen, bathed in natural light. The kitchen is thoughtfully equipped with high-quality units, featuring a full range of white goods and electrical appliances. A large central island and a cozy breakfast nook add to the kitchen&apos;s appeal. For those who relish al fresco breakfasts, a door opens to a charming Andalusian patio—a serene space to plan your day while enjoying a leisurely meal.

On the opposite side of the main entrance, two generously sized bedrooms, each complemented by quality fitted bathrooms, await. The front-facing bedroom provides direct access to the main terrace, enhancing the overall accessibility and aesthetic of the space.

The upper level of the property is reserved for a truly magnificent master suite, distinguished by a vaulted ceiling, a walk-in dressing room, and an inviting, spacious bathroom. Adding to the allure of the master suite is a feature mezzanine accessible via the dressing room—an ideal spot for a discreet lounge or internal chill-out zone. This area seamlessly connects to the expansive upper terrace, currently a blank canvas but with the potential to serve as an additional outdoor entertaining or sunbathing space. From this vantage point, the panoramic views are nothing short of spectacular.

Descending to the lower level of the home, you&apos;ll discover two additional bedrooms, each accompanied by its own bathroom. Adjacent to these rooms is a versatile space that could serve as guest or staff quarters, or be repurposed as a home office, games room, or gymnasium—allowing the new owner the freedom to personalize the property to their liking. The potential for creative modifications remains, presenting an exciting opportunity for customization.

Exiting from this level leads directly to the inviting pool area, creating an atmosphere that beckons for relaxation and enjoyment. The property also boasts a garage and private parking for several cars, ensuring both convenience and security.

The immediate surroundings feature an orchard garden adorned with a variety of fruit trees, providing a pleasant backdrop. Beyond lies a vast, untouched mountainside landscape, contributing to the property&apos;s sense of tranquility and connection with nature.

This is a high-quality property offered at a remarkably competitive price, situated in an enviable location that is just a short drive from shops, restaurants, and all local amenities. Moreover, the allure of Puerto Banus, though seemingly in another world, is a mere 8-minute drive away, adding a touch of glamour to the property&apos;s already desirable setting.
