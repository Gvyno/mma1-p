Bolthole by the Sea

Properties in Torreguadiaro are in high demand & hard to find. Especially, one as close to the sea as this one.

With stunning panoramic sea views from the south facing terrace; a communal walkway that you are able to put tables & chairs from which to admire it from.  And with only 4 neighbours, it is very peaceful. The beach itself is less than a minutes walk & Sotogrande marina no more than 10 minutes walk.

It has 2 bedrooms, 1 bathroom & is approximately 58 square metres.

The property is in pristine condition & has recently been repainted.

It is excellently located for all the tapas bars, restaurants & shops that are much loved in Torreguadiaro and the proximity to Sotogrande is the icing on the cake!

The price is a fair price, given the demand for Torreguadiaro & viewings are highly recommended.

Note: This a third floor property without a lift
