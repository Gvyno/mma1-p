In the urbanization El Pilar, in the area with the same name and with fantastic views from the roof terrace, we find this bright flat with 2 bedrooms and 2 complete bathrooms.

After entering the gated community and parking our vehicle in the interior parking spaces, we can choose whether to go up to the flat by lift or by the stairs.

As soon as we enter the flat we find a short corridor and to the right an elegant kitchen, very luminous and with all the services to enjoy cooking.

At the front of the hallway and with unbeatable natural light, is the dining room area open to the living room. Crossing the living room we access the terrace with open views to the garden and swimming pool of the adjoining urbanization.

Halfway through the living room, a corridor opens to the left and right.
On the right side we find a complete bathroom with bathtub and at the end of the corridor the master bedroom with access to a small terrace.
On the other side we find a bathroom with a practical shower, and at the end another bedroom, of generous dimensions. A sliding door leads to an enclosed terrace which is currently used as an office.

Leaving the living room onto the terrace, a spiral staircase leads to the roof terrace. The entire surface of the roof terrace is functional, which means that there are a multitude of possibilities to enjoy it. From the roof terrace we have 360º views of the whole area.

At the entrance to the urbanisation from the road is the El Pilar shopping centre, with restaurants, cafeteria, bars, supermarket, gymnasium, notary's office, golf shop, etc... 
Its location between Estepona centre and Marbella is unbeatable. HP1
