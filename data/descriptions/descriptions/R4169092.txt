This finca is located in the beautiful countryside of Alhaurin El Grande.

The property is set on a completely flat plot of 4.500m² with stunning garden areas, private pool area surrounded by trees and what could be a lovely covered terrace to enjoy outside dining. It also has numerous outbuildings on the plot, one of them currently being used as a chicken pen.

The house is on one level and features 3 double sized bedrooms, one of them with ensuite, and another family bathroom, spacious lounge and separate kitchen with dining room table. It is in need of updating but it could be made into a lovely country finca with plenty of land to enjoy the outside.

Only 8 minutes by car from the well known town of Alhaurin el Grande and 4 minutes to Lauro Golf Resort!
