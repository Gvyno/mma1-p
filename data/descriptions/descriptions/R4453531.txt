Excellent flat with partial sea views, with 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, one of the bedrooms is a suite, all spaces are very bright due to its positioning, the kitchen is very well positioned with large windows, then there is a living room that gives direct access to the terrace which is very spacious, which expands to one side of the flat with excellent views.

There is an underground garage with storage room, the security of the building is excellent and the communal pool is very inviting.

Excellent investment for all year, to living and holidays, as it is close to all amenities and only a few minutes walk to the Estepona marina which offers the best restaurants and entertainment facilities.
