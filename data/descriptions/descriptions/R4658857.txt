This lovely country home sits on a flat plot of land with views to the Mijas mountains.

On the ground floor is the living room with pellet burner, modern fitted kitchen with dining area, 2 bedrooms with a shared bathroom, and the very spacious master bedroom with dressing area and ensuite bathroom.

Via an external staircase you access the fourth bedroom with a private terrace, from where you can enjoy the incredible views.

The property benefits from a wonderful, covered barbecue and bar with dining area, which is perfect for entertaining guests or relaxing with family and friends. 

The pool is slightly raised and is surrounded by the orchard, planted with a variety of fruit trees such oranges, lemons, almonds, and walnuts. On the plot there are also several outbuildings, which have been used for chicken and pigs, but they could be used as stables.
