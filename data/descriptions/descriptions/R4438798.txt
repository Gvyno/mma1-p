Nestled in the heart of the picturesque Benahavis, there exists a plot of land that has long been a focal point of the village. This cherished location is now the canvas for an ambitious project that seeks to transform it into a vibrant community hub. The project envisions the construction of 40 modern apartments that seamlessly blend contemporary living with the charm of rural life.
