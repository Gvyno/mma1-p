Beautiful office of 53 m2 on the top floor of a large business shopping center, in the same Puerto Banus, a stone's throw from Corte Ingles.
  The office has a guest toilet and small kitchen, as well as storage cupboards.
  The views are spectacular to the sea.
All kinds of businesses in the Shopping Center, elevator, garages etc
Without a doubt an excellent investment.
