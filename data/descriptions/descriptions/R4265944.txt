Situated at the foot of the Sierra Bermeja mountains, the former fishing village presents itself as an ideal place to live for families and people who appreciate life outside the more commercial areas of the Costa del Sol. Nestled in the cobbled streets, the town center offers many traditional stores, bars and restaurants with a wide variety of dishes to suit all tastes. Estepona's popular marina is characterized by its pleasant Spanish atmosphere and enjoys splendid views of its magnificent yachts and the Mediterranean Sea. An attractive place to stroll with friends or family, the port offers the same good food from noon to night. The promenade has a wide and clean sandy beach, which on many occasions has been awarded the European Blue Flag and offers beach bars scattered along its length. Estepona is an ideal place for a vacation home or permanent residence.
