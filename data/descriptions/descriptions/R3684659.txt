Stunning penthouse with panoramic views to the sea and the mountains, located 100 meters from the sandy beaches of Costalita!
All the living accommodation is on one level and a spiral staircase takes you to the solarium upstairs. As you enter this beautiful property you are stunned by the direct views out to the beach from the large oval shaped living room. This room is joined by a semi-open plan modern kitchen. Further along there are 2 guest bedrooms with 2 bathrooms and a master bedroom with an en-suite bathroom and private terrace. The whole apartment has underfloor heating and is air conditioned. Next to the living room you will find a large semi covered terrace with BBQ area, ideal for outdoor dining! Upstairs is a solarium terrace the same size as the whole apartment. It is partially covered above the large jacuzzi and lounge area, and leaves plenty of space for sun loungers. The views are 360 degrees panoramic, from the mountains at the back of Estepona and Marbella to the coast and as far as Gibraltar and Africa.
The community has a lovely garden area, with a large swimming pool and also a snack bar in the summer months. Sold with a large (2 car) underground parking space and storage room.
