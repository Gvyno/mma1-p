Residencia Jarazmin defines a new lifestyle, a concept of housing with services for the elderly.

People who appreciate the advantages of having in their own home all the services they may need, both domestic and hotel and, where appropriate, care services, while providing a high level of comfort and absolute independence and privacy.

Jarazmin is ideal for people who are at a stage in their lives when they can dedicate themselves to living and enjoying life in safety. They do not spend their time solving problems that directly affect their basic needs and prefer to invest in activities that provide them with happiness and well-being. Jarazmin is the reward.

The Jarazmin Residence has been designed so that the elderly have all their needs taken care of. Spacious suites are available. All of them have a kitchen, television, telephone, adapted bathroom, etc... those details that you still consider essential in your home are also in your room at the Jarazmin Residences for the Elderly.

The building has been designed by specialists in the development and execution of decoration projects in the hotel and clinic sector, combining elegance in design with comfort and safety for its users.

Here your only concern will be to enjoy life intensely.
