The property has large windows that provide an incomparable light quality to the house, thus enhancing the design and style of its lines.

From the living-dining room with the open and integrated kitchen, located on the ground floor of the house, you can appreciate the fantastic views of the valley of the golf course.

On the upper floor, there are 4 wonderful bedrooms with their en-suite bathrooms, although it could be 5 bedrooms, as there is a large basement space that could be used.
