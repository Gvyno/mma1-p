This is a great investment opportunity for those who want to build the home of their dreams on a charming house from the 19th century, in the historic centre of San Martín del Tesorillo, Cádiz. Currently, it is the only and last one available for restoration, and consists of a integral renovation project completed in 2019.

If desired, it's also possible to renew it respecting the current distribution, as can be seen in the renders developed by the interior design studio Fuga y Fusión. The total cost, including the purchase of the property and the renovation to leave it as in the renders, is estimated at approximately €380,000. In this way, the ground level entrance would consist of the spacious living room with dining area and a television room. The fully-equipped kitchen would be independent and overlook the private terrace. The charming outdoor spaces will allow the owners and their guests to enjoy the outdoors in maximum privacy: chill-out, solarium with sun loungers, private swimming pool and dining space. As for the upper level, it boasts the master suite with its own private bathroom and walk-in wardrobe; and the two double guest bedrooms, each with built-in wardrobes and access to the terrace, which share a fully fitted bathroom.

Its unbeatable location will allow the owners to enjoy a comfortable and quiet lifestyle, since being in the centre it's a short walk from all services (supermarkets, school and high school, parks, central square, bars and other amenities). In addition, it's surrounded by internationally recognized golf courses as well as polo fields such as Santa María Polo Club or Ayala, as well as the Dos Lunas equestrian complex. Both the beach and the marina of Sotogrande and the gastronomic area of Torreguadiaro are less than ten minutes away by car.

This is a perfect chance to get a historic house that is ideal as a first residence, second holiday home or investment for the future, in a quiet and safe rural environment, with spaces for practicing sports or horseback riding, while being perfectly connected with the town centre and all the services that the Costa del Sol offers.
