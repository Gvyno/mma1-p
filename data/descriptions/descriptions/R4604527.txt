A south-west orientated building plot in East Marbella´s gorgeous residential estate known as El Rosario.
This plot does not come with a project. The images are only to show the possibility.
This is an opportunity to develop a luxury home with fabulous views over the Marbella countryside and golf course to the Mediterranean Sea.
This plot has a building coefficient of 0.30 allowing therefore for a luxury home with above-ground build size of up to 323 sqm. Additional space can be made in the basement.
El Rosario is undergoing a mandatory update to connect each home to the mains sewage system, and this plot has the infrastructure in place and already paid for at a cost of 12,000 euro.
