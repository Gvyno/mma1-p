Lovely apartment on the first floor of a very well located residence.
Small terrace (7m2) but the communal areas and the proximity of San Pedro`s promenade make up for this.
The gated, beachside resort (300 metres from Alabardero Chiringuito and Mar Abierta restaurant)  has a fabulous swimming pool, a large childrens pool, and a padel court.
There is underground parking, very useful during the high season!
The apartment consists of a salon, dining area, small terrace, two bedrooms, one bathroom, and fully equipped kitchen.
We already have several apartments rented out in this resort on a short term basis for our customers - proof of rental income available.  These are beachside, very reasonably priced apartments with great return!
If your client is looking for a holiday apartment with rental potential:  this is perfect,

The owner has actually 3 apartments for sale in the resort, there is a special price for an investor that buys all 3.
