Royal Marbella Golf Resort is a private oasis on the edge of El Paraiso Golf – a haven of tranquillity at the point where Marbella, Estepona and Benahavis meet. Everything, from beaches to nightlife, is on your doorstep, but owners and guests at the resort also have access to a high standard of on-site amenities and service within a beautiful setting.
The style and feel is of an idealised Mediterranean village, complete with intimate squares and pathways that lead from the main reception and concierge area to the independent suites. It is an ambient and inviting setting, with café, bar lounge and terrace, two superb swimming pools and sunbathing decks surrounded by lush gardens. The resort also features a professionally equipped gymnasium and a private spa with sauna and changing facilities.
With a choice of one and two bedroom apartments, plus three-bedroom duplexes, your apartment is comfortable and modern, well-equipped and spacious. These fully maintained and serviced suites are surrounded by Mediterranean gardens within a boutique resort with private parking, hotel service and leisure amenities. 

The owner will be able to use the property 31 days per year, the rest will be rented by the hotel with the profits being split between the owner and the hotel.
