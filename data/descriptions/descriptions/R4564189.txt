Situated on an elevated plot in a quiet dead end street, with lovely views of the golf valley, Mediterranean, stretching out to Gibraltar and even the mountains of Morocco on a clear day. An ample living room greets the entrance with adjacent dining area and a large open plan modern kitchen separated by an impressive central gas chimney. Double-glazed sliding glass doors with electric blinds lead the living room out to a large covered terrace, surrounding an infinity pool overlooking the views, with heating option pre-installed.

The flow between spaces is carefully planned in Condor Viejo's design, making the living & dining rooms, kitchen and terraces merge effortlessly into a single area, perfect for gatherings.
