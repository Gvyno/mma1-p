We have several plots for sale in Marbella Club Golf Resort, a private, gated complex, with 24-hour security and concierge service, private golf course and equestrian center. All the plots have beautiful views combining the forest of the area, with the golf course, the views of the sea and the African coast and some even the horse jumping competition track. The complex also has a very nice Club House with really professional service and friendly atmosphere.

Specifically, this plot is facing and bending towards the southwest, meaning lots of daylight. It has sea views and also forest views. The urban regulations allow building about 435 m2 split between the ground floor and first floor, but you can also build an extra basement which, given the slope of the terrain, would also have beautiful views.
