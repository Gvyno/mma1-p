PALOMA PARK! Great opportunity to acquire an apartment located around the highly sought after Parque La Paloma, a much-loved residential area in Benalmádena. This property has two bedrooms, two bathrooms, a spacious living room that opens onto a terrace that offers magnificent views of the surroundings and the sea. The apartment is sold with a parking space and a storage room. Residence with a beautiful pool and green spaces. Very good opportunity, as there are only very few properties available around the park that also offer the possibility of walking to the beach. The center of Arroyo de la Miel is a few minutes' walk away with its shops, typical restaurants and train station. Malaga International Airport is 20 minutes away by car. Has tourist licence, excellent investment and high rental income.
