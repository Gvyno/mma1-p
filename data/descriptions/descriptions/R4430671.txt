How about a refurbished  ground floor corner unit with a 16 sqm terrace (can be extended), a 33 sqm double underground parking space and a storage unit of the same size as the terrace? Three bedrooms and two bathrooms. The area is as peaceful as the garden of Eden and keep in mind that you are only 5 minutes  away from the beach (by car) and you have several golf courses in the vicinity, Finca Cortesin being one of them. It´s now or never, as Elvis Presley sings.
