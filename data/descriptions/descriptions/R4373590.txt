A very presentable and spacious penthouse with 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms situated in the La Campana area of Nueva Andalucia.  This property is ideal for families as it offers ample living space and a good sized terrace. It has been thoroughly reformed to a high standard and the present owner has incorporated some lovely features into the property such as the gymnasium. Two living areas provide a choice of where to relax. A large part of the terrace has been professionally enclosed and provides a second living room or dining area of 50m as well as the gym. Everything has been done with good quality materials and include lovely flooring and high quality windows.  From the ample terrace, there are lovely open views of the mountains and surrounding countryside. The penthouse includes 2 parking spaces and a storage room in the underground garage. Although there is no swimming pool, the fantastic new Sports Center is currently in construction and is forecast to be completed this year and is only a short walk away.
