Excellent opportunity for investment located in the very heart of Marbella, just in front of the Alameda, in the main artery of the city, and being part at the same time of the Old Town. This is a 158sqm built, with a south facing terrace with views to the lush Alameda greenery. Either acquiring the property to reform and use it as a first dwelling, with its initial three  bedrooms and two bathrooms, all services and facilities at hand, as 24/7 pharmacy, supermarkets, and a plethora of convenience stores and traditional groceries, besides an ample underground parking spot at a mere 100m of distance, and the beach at 200m. Or acquiring the flat to renovate it (a less burdensome operation) and allocate offices in the premises, as its location entitles the property as a unit in the Legal and Economic business centre, since almost all the law firms and professional offices can be found in the area. One way or another, these premises have an indisputable potential rate to return the investment needed. We have keys and total availability to visit.
