fantastic commercial premises in the heart of Marbella. This space has 200 square meters distributed in 2 separate premises and with many possibilities. One part is a restaurant with a kitchen, toilets, warehouse, large dining room and the possibility of setting up tables in a quiet square. The other part is an office, currently a professional and fully operational office. Fantastic for its location surrounded by shops of all kinds and a lot of people passing by. It is an excellent investment option since the 2 premises can be rented separately or together. It has many possibilities of use.
