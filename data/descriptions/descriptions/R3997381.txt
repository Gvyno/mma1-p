One of the last remaining front line golf plots on the coast. A 1500sqm plot with permission for a 300sqm build excluding patios and terraces. There are two plots together that could be bought for anyone who would like a 600sqm build on a 3000sqm plot. Apart from being front line golf they are a 10-15min walk to bars and restaurants, St Anthoney's school, gym paddle/tennis courts and gym. 5-10min drive to the centre of of town and beaches, 20-25 from the airport. 
You also have the option to purchase the project and build. A four bed four bath villa with swimming pool 999.000€ Now that's a Bargain. This would make a great investment,  especially with the reopening of the, close by, 5 star BYBLOS HOTEL that can boast clientele such as Princess Diana, The Rolling Stones, Julio Iglesias, Andrew Seal and many more. Really is a must see
