Great investment opportunity in Marbella Old Town.
Fantastic purchase opportunity in unbeatable location of the old town, at a stone's throw from Plaza de los Naranjos and La Encarnación church.
The property is a town-house with a lot of character and a built area of 315 sqm. The house is accessed through a beautiful Andalusian patio, it is distributed into ground floor plus two floors and has several outbuildings.
The townhouse used to be a popular night bar with an apartment on top but can now be reconverted into a large size family house or small apartments to rent .

Reforms are needed .
