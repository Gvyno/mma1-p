This commercial plot is located in a unique location on a hill with a magnificent view of the sea in front, nature and the Sierra de Mijas mountain behind. In the middle of nature but in a very desirable gated community for maximum security and centrally located, close to the A7 and the AP7. A luxury nursing home, a chic boutique hotel or an exclusive spa would be a good fit here, given the demand for these types of facilities and the premier tennis and padel club within walking distance.

Next to this commercial plot are two residential plots with plans/drawings incl. permits (675m2 for 399k and 1,613m2 for 615k) for spacious, luxurious villas. All plots are on the edge of a beautiful gated community of villas just 15 minutes drive from the airport, 10 minutes from the coast, Mijas Pueblo and Fuengirola and 15 minutes walking distance from two restaurants and a well-known, superb tennis and padel club.

In addition, there is a smaller plot without plan/permit for 275k. All 4 plots can be purchased separately or together (€1,750,000).
