"Enjoy breathtaking open sea and mountain views from the charming Southeast-facing covered terrace of this corner apartment. Situated within a secure and impeccably maintained urbanization, this community offers four outdoor pools, one indoor pool, a spa, and a well-equipped gym.

The monthly community fees are set at a very acceptable rate, considering the extensive facilities, beautiful communal gardens, and round-the-clock security service. Originally the showflat, this well-built 2-bedroom, 2-bathroom apartment is meticulously maintained and tastefully decorated.

Included in the asking price are the furnishings, two spacious underground private parking spaces, and a decently sized storage room. Conveniently located within walking distance of a supermarket, golf course, and various restaurants, the complex is only a short drive away from Benahavis, San Pedro de Alcantara, and the beach."
