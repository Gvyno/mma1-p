Cosy elevated ground floor unit in a sought after complex! Immaculate condition, sunny terrace all day. Very bright throughout due to its south orientation. Nice layout with an open space as you enter, including kitchen, living room, and a separate dining room area with enough space. The rest of the unit includes a master bedroom of good size with ensuite bathroom, a second bedroom, and second full bathroom. There is plenty of storage space and wardrobes, and a separate laundry area. The price comes with a private underground parking spot. The urbanisation has 24h security, several adult and children swimming pools, mini market, saunas, club house with restaurant, and of course direct golf access, all minutes away walking. The golf course is one of the best in the area, and well maintained all year round. Keys in office!
