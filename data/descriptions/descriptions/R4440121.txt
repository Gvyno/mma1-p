Stunning penthouse with a wraparound terrace situated in the upper part of Calahonda offering stunning panoramic sea and mountain views. The property has beed refurbished to a very high standard and is tastefully decorated with most of the furniture remaining after the sale has been agreed. Being on the top floor ensures all rooms are bright and spacious but what truly sets this property apart from the rest is the size of the outdoor living space...... its offering quality of life.

Not mention its location 5 minutes to the beach, 20 minutes from the airport and Marbella in the opposite direction, 10 minutes from the popular La Cala and walking distance to public transport, bars and restaurants.

Really is a must see
