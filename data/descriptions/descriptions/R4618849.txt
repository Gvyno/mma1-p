Experience serenity and potential in this charming home with nice views and a lush garden in Marbella.

Located in a tranquil south-facing oasis, this charming 142 sqm house for sale offers a unique retreat imbued with serenity and abundant possibilities. With a beautiful 747,85 sqm garden, fruit trees, natural views, and a 32 sqm porch, this property is a haven of peace and promises a lifestyle that seamlessly combines comfort, beauty, and potential. Since the construction dates back to 1970, certain repairs need to be carried out.

As you approach the residence, the lush greenery of the garden welcomes you, creating a sense of tranquility from the very first glance. The meticulously landscaped outdoor space provides a peaceful sanctuary, ideal for relaxation, entertaining guests, or enjoying al fresco dining. The garden is not just an extension of the house but a vital part of its charm, offering a harmonious blend of nature and living space.

Upon entering, you'll find a home that exudes a warm and inviting atmosphere, featuring a fireplace in the living room. The interior spaces of the house are functional, though they could benefit from some arrangements. The house serves as a canvas ready for personalization, allowing you to tailor it to your unique preferences and lifestyle. Well-lit rooms create an ambiance of openness and comfort, facilitating the vision of a life of tranquility and satisfaction within these walls.

Whether sipping your morning coffee, relaxing in the garden, or unwinding in the comfort of your living room, the ever-changing seascape provides a breathtaking backdrop. The nice views not only enhance the visual appeal of the property but also create a connection between the interior and the vast, beautiful expanse beyond.

In addition to the 3 bedroom, 3 bathroom villa, the property features a fantastic independent studio of 18 sqm next to the house, fully equipped with a kitchen and full bathroom. Ideal space for converting into an office or renting out.

In conclusion, this house with its garden and inherent potential is not just a property; it's an opportunity to create a personalized haven where every detail reflects your taste and style. Another positive aspect of the property is that, despite being in the Ricmar neighborhood (a very quiet and safe area with a neighborhood atmosphere), it does not belong to any community, avoiding the payment of significant community service costs. Seize the tranquility, savor the views, and embark on a journey to transform this house into the retreat of your dreams.
