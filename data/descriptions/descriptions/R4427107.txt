Wonderful apartment located in a central area of Torremolinos.

The house is located on the 4th floor and consists of a useful area of 80m² distributed in a hall, a large living-dining room that has access to a spacious terrace with views of the street, a long hallway that gives access to three large bedrooms and two bathrooms. An equipped kitchen with space to use it as a dining room, and a laundry room. The building has an elevator and a community pool.

Just 3 minutes walk from Calle San Miguel, the busiest pedestrian street in Torremolinos, and considered one of the busiest in Europe. It is the commercial hub par excellence of the town and the main tourist area.

Close to supermarkets, shops, bars, restaurants, schools, pharmacies, train and bus stations. And just 800m from the beach.
