Andalusian style modernised Villa, located in Atalaya Alta.

There are two double bedrooms on the ground floor, a bathroom, kitchen, a separate dining room and a lounge room. Through the lounge you gain access onto a large size covered terrace leading directly onto the garden and the large heated pool.

On the first floor via the original style Andalucian staircase there are another three double bedrooms with two bathrooms, master one on-suite and a large size private terrace. One of the bedrooms has its own, large-size covered, private terrace - offering wonderful views of the huge size landscaped garden, swimming pool, overseeing the surrounding area and affording a sea view.

All bedrooms with A/C Kommerling double glazing doors and windows - with integral external, electric blinds (shutters).
The large, lush, landscaped and quiet garden (size over 1,000 sq.m.) has a specially fitted BBQ, table tennis, basket-ball throw fixture, well maintained palm trees, where beautiful and enjoyable holidays or entertaining parties can be enjoyed.

A great feature is the private, large size (12m x 6m) heated outdoor pool (with an electric cover for cooler nights) - with glamorous LED night lights and a large water cascade. Next to the pool entrance is the solar heated shower, providing convenience and comfort. 

The villa has a separate garage and additional off-street parking space for at least 2 more cars.
Sophisticated video alarm system makes this private detached house extremely safe and sound.
