Imagine having your favorite drink reclining on a comfortable chair on your patio, enjoying the sun rays  and breathing the splendit air of the Costa del Sol, and suddenly you feel like going to eat out at a beach bar and swim in the sea! You just will have to decide which beach bar to go to, because you may simply walk, that's how close everything is to this house. If you came back from the supermarket and realize that you forgot something…. calm down, not a big deal…. You can find all the shops you need, just a few steps from here! Those are just some of the advantages that you could have if you were to live in this house in Los Boliches.
Another advantage of this home is that it is built all on one floor and that it has 4 spacious and bright rooms. The kitchen is opening to the living room to give a feeling of great spaciousness and there are 2 full bathrooms, one with a shower and the other with bathtub.
It is on a flat plot of 200 m2, with a porch and a patio in the back area. The house has a 131 m2 constructed area.
