If you want spectacular views and peace and quiet, this is your home! Marvelous remodeled apartment in a very nice community in upper part of Los Pacos. 
Indoor space has been remodeled and bedrooms are bigger in the original layout.  In the bathroom you have underfloor heating to enjoy warm tiles under your toes. Magnific 22m2 south west facing glazed terrace where you can enjoy panoramic 180 degree views and even wintertime the apartment does not need warming although there is two years old new aircon central machine!
The community has very well-maintained common areas with big a swimming pool, communal laundry room and even a gym! It also has a garage.
We have the keys!
