SELLS this spectacular large apartment, consists of 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms, one of them en suite.
You enter through a corridor that leads to the living room that is very wide with access to the terrace. It is very bright with large windows.
Then the corridor takes us to the kitchen with laundry, modern style and high-end appliances.

We continue and arrive at the master bedroom with its en suite bathroom and access to the terrace on the left and on the right the guest bedroom. The second bathroom is in the hallway to serve also for the guests.

It is very cute and decorated with great pleasure.
