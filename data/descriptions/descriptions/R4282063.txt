*** Investment Opportunity!!! *** Building to Renovate in Avda Reyes Católicos, Alhaurín de la Torre, Málaga *** Feasibility Study Completed *** Residential Use *** Possibility of Building a Multi-Family Building with 9 Homes with Underground Parking, Storage Units and Commercial Premises ** * 3 Levels above Ground (in addition to Basement and Ground Level) *** Ideal Location: 15 Minutes by Car from the Center of Malaga ***

This is a great investment opportunity considering the possibilities of the building, in which it is possible to build a total of nine multi-family homes, underground parking (with nine spaces and four storage rooms) and a 156 m2 commercial area. It would be possible to build two additional levels: attic and basement.

The use is residential and there is already a construction project with a feasibility study, so it could begin to be marketed within a period of six months from its purchase.

Its location is ideal, since it is in one of the most central avenues of Alhaurín de la Torre, a quiet and safe municipality just ten minutes by car from the center of Malaga and the beach.
