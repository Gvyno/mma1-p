Wow! A spectacular three bedroom house located just a 12 minute walk to the beach in the popular village of La Cala de Mijas.

The property is the best positioned house in the complex, south facing with incredible sea views from each of its three terraces.  

It consists of, on the entrance level, entrance hall, lounge diner, independent fully fitted kitchen, guest cloakroom which is currently used as a utility room, and a double bedroom with an ensuite bathroom. The lounge gives access to a lovely south facing terrace with open panoramic sea views over La Cala de Mijas. At the front of the house there is a large porch which can be used either as a car port or as the current owners use it, as an outdoor dining and barbecue area.

Upstairs we find a further two double bedrooms and two full bathrooms, the master with its own ensuite. Both bedrooms enjoy unobstructed sea views. There is no shortage of outside space on this level either as both the bedrooms share another large open terrace which has stairs leading up to a rooftop solarium where the views are absolutely incredible.

Priced to sell, the property features hot and cold air-conditioning and double glazing. Fibre optic internet is available.

The development is gated and secure and features a communal swimming pool, private parking for residents and a padel tennis court as well as security guard.

An impressive property with views to die for in a fabulous location.
