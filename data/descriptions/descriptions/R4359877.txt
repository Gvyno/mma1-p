With a little investment this property could be transformed into two studio apartments... allowing an exceptionally good rental income for your investment.

We bring to you this wonderful 1 bedroom apartment in Torres De Andalucia.
Well known as a popular Holiday Rental building, this apartment is situated on the 4th floor.
Unlike most of the apartments in the building, this property is NOT a studio, but a spacious 71 sq meter one bedroom apartment.

On entering the property you are immediately taken by how large the living area is. 
Bright, airy and naturally cool.
The traditional Andalucial architecture is captured in the tiles floor.
While the apartment is immactulately kept by it's current owner, there is still lots of things that can be done to personalise your new Marbella home to your exact requirements, without spending lots of money!

Rarely do we find on the market, such a property that while only one bedroom, can be furnished to cater for 4 guests. The living area is so spacious that a sofa bed will increase the rental potential considerably.

Complete with a private terrace and a very well equipped kitchen, this property is sure to be popular with buyers as it is ideal as a private holiday get away due to its 'lock up and go' situation, but also highly desirable as a holiday rental property.

La Torre de Andalucia is an iconic building within the Golf valley, yet still close to the beach. One of the only high rise buildings it is conveniently located within a short walk of the shops and restaurants of La Campana

Within the building itself is a concierge, supermarket, gardens and swimming pool. There is a popular cafe.

The building is popular with residents and holidaymakers alike

It is priced to sell!!
