Corner house with incredible views of the Guadalhorce Valley, in Alhaurín el Grande

This property, of more than 160 m2 built, is in an unbeatable location, in the center of town, and within walking distance of schools, supermarkets, restaurants, and all services.

The house consists of a ground floor garage for two cars and storage.
On the first floor we have two bedrooms, living room, kitchen, bathroom, patio and balcony. The house is being renovated, so it is not furnished (THE FURNISHED KITCHEN IS A SIMULATION OF HOW IT COULD BE WHEN FINISHED).
On the second floor, we have a terrace-solarium of 50 m2 with a multipurpose room of 16m2, a bathroom and a laundry room, which can be converted into a more buildable floor by planning regulations and move upstairs the new terrace.
