Charming farm located in the heart of the Serranía de Ronda, in a very quiet place, where you can enjoy nature.

Arriving at the farm, we find a wonderful Mediterranean terrace surrounded by vines, where we can enjoy the shade provided by its vineyards.

The land has a house with 3 bedrooms, two bathrooms, a kitchen with views of the pool and a large living room with a fireplace.

It consists of a total of approximately 10,000 m2, a small olive plantation (150 units), two wells with drinking water and an irrigation system.

Accessible entrance to the farm and its surroundings just 8 minutes from the incredible city of Ronda.

Really interesting property. I invite you to come and meet her, you will end up in love with her. JDS
