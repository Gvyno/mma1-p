A very nice apartment with a perfect location near the beach in Riviera del Sol and Miraflores.
The apartment consists of two bedrooms and two bathrooms, a kitchen and a bright living room with a cozy dining area and direct access to the terrace. The home has a well-planned floor plan with a homely feel. The terrace is in a perfect location so you can enjoy the sun during the morning and you can go down to any of the two shared pools which have a nice green area around where you can lie and sunbathe and socialize. If you feel more like going down and cooling off in the sea, it's only a short walk away.

Nearby there is a large selection of nice restaurants, well-stocked grocery stores and shops. If you follow the promenade you will come into the center of charming La Cala or in the other direction towards Marbella you will come to the picturesque port of Cabopino with its Natural Dunes. It is a quiet and peaceful area with good connections to both Marbella and Malaga airport.
