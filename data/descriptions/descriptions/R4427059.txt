For those who think that living in the Old Town of Marbella is a privilege. Beautiful family house with 3 floors plus solarium with 360 degree views. All the advantages of living in the center of the city in a quiet environment very close to all commercial activity but at a sufficient distance from noise, both from bars and vehicles as it is on a only pedestrian street. Corner house with a small covered patio on the ground floor, living room with fireplace, large kitchen and a full bathroom with a bathtub. On the first floor we have large closets in a dressing area, two bedrooms and a modern bathroom with a shower, on the second floor two more bedrooms with the third bathroom. Above this room and via an external staircase, you access the solarium, a very enjoyable place with wide views and ideal for enjoying sunsets and barbecues in an outdoor area. LSC.
