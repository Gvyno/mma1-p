The apartment is a very spacious one bedroom. It has the kitchen to the right and the lounge area with dining area directly before you, leading out to a huge terrace. The terrace is sheltered and has the most beautiful views. The bedroom and bathroom have lots of space and the apartment is modern. The facilities of this urbanisation are second to none. There is a very generous storage room down a corridor, on the same level as the apartment. The garage is just down the stairs, so again, giving ease of access to the apartment and good for people with mobility issues.
