You've arrived, a two-bedroom townhouse fully refurbished to the highest level in El Alto, a prestigious urbanisation in Los Arqueros Country Club. Contemporary features seamlessly blending natural materials and interiors with Mediterranean exterior to create a superb townhouse. Most of the units in this urbanisa8tion are apartments so this is one of the rare townhouses available that do not come up for sale very often. 

This townhouse has undergone a fantastic refurbishment so this is a key ready property ready to find its new owners. It features entrance level with two en-suite bedrooms. One of the bedrooms has a spacious terrace with 180-degree views. One flight of stairs down lead to the open living room, dining, and kitchen area. A bright and spacious area to enjoy all year round. This level also has a guest toilet and storage. From the kitchen you also have a small patio currently used as BBQ area. From the living room there is direct access out to a stunning terrace. This offers a beautiful spot for dining or lounging. A few steps down leads to the shared garden which is shared between two townhouses.  

One garage and one storage included in the price.

The community itself is very charming and has two swimming pools with picturesque pathways with Alhambra architectural features. It is situated within walking distance to the clubhouse so you could not be better situated if you are a golf fanatic. The clubhouse includes a restaurant, gym, tennis, squash, sauna and of course golf. El Alto overlooks the 18-hole golf course and was built in the style of a white Spanish village so what makes this unit so lovely is the modern interior coupled with this warm cosy style of the urbanisation. 

This is a perfect permanent residence as you are tucked away to enjoy the peace and tranquillity yet within easy reach to all amenities.
