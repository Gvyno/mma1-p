Great opportunity to buy an apartment in the very sought after Oasis in La Cala de Mijas.  Here you will find two great advantages, one the Location as it is within walking distance of all amenities and secondly the size and standard of building are what give it that edge, not to mention the price.  It is just that little bit above the standard of any  other second hand Property available in La Cala and  as we  all  know new builds are a lot more expensive, so it is a perfect investment.

This apartment is on the first floor and is in excellent condition as has been looked after the owners really well and have only used by themselves so very little wear and tear.  It has a lovely open plan kitchen/sitting dining room which leads out to a nice covered terrace with  lateral sea views.  Off the sitting room you have two double bedrooms and two bathrooms, the master bedroom has a bathroom ensuite and this also leads out to the terrace.

The apartment is being sold fully furnished and comes with underground parking and storeroom.

The complex is gated and has two swimming pool areas.

As said above the location is excellent and you can walk to the beach and board walk, into the village of La Cala de Mijas.  Only 10 mins drive to Fuengirola and 20 to the centre of Marbella., surrounded by numerous golf courses, schools, La Cala also has an open market on Wednesday and Saturday mornings, one of the best places to live on the Costa del Sol both for young people or to enjoy your retirement.  

This is ideal to live in all year around, use as a holiday home, perfect for remote working and also has great rental potential.
