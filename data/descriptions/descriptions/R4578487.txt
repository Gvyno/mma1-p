Located in a small complex of houses called Colinas Del Golf in the prestigious La Cala Golf urbanisation which is within a 10 minute drive of the popular Spanish coastal town of La Cala De Mijas. This super house is also within a 5 - 10 minute walk to the hotel and the Golf club with restaurants, a gym, health club, Spa facilities and Golf available for your enjoyment! On entering this lovely house you are struck by the impressive hallway and staircase with the high ceiling. Both the partially open kitchen and the living/dining area are very spacious.
