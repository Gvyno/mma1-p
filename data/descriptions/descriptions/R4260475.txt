Excellent villa with amazing sea views located in the established Cumbres area of Elviria, and with only 5 minutes walking distance down to shops and restaurants. The beach is less than 20 minnutes walk away. This villa is set on a large plot, very private, and has open and uninterrupted views straight down to the sea. It is built over 2 levels and also has a separate covered gazebo-style terrace, perfect for BBQ and al-fresco dining. You enter on the main floor and get those views to the sea as you open the front door and step into the hallway. The living room is large and wide, and very luminous. The kitchen is adjacent to the living room (easy to open up) and also has doors leading straight to the terrace. The master bedroom and two guest bedrooms are located on this level, all with newly refurbished bathrooms (with underfloor heating). Downstairs has another huge bedroom (space for at least 3 single beds), a guest bedroom, a large bathroom, large utility room and a versatile room perfect as games room, entertainment/bar room or gym. Mature garden with a heated swimming pool.
This villa has had many upgrades over the years, and also an excellent rental history. Perfect for permanent living or as a holiday villa!
