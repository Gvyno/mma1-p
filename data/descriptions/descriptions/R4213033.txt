This 2 bedroom property features an open plan design and has been been renovated to a very high standard. On entering the house you appreciate the spacious kitchen-lounge which leads directly onto the large sunny terrace. Large terrace which also leads onto a  community garden.In addition there is a private garden at the front of the property. The master bedroom has a double bed and fitted wardrobe,  with views towards the gardens. A modern bathroom with walk in shower and second bedroom with a single bed completes the property.
