This is an excellent opportunity to buy an apartment in a very sought after complex offering the best of both worlds very close to the beach, marina, restaurants, but also very close to the golf.
This apartment is just around 10 minutes walk to Cabopino Marina. The complex is a secured gated complex with a nice pool and gardens. This larger than average apartment has a brand new  modern kitchen and is in very good condition throughout.
