An elegant modern one-level newly built villa (199 m2) with a private heated pool and a fantastic big garden around the villa. 

High quality throughout the building, high selling, and big windows bring natural light and a luxurious feel.
It is in a great, quiet, safe, family area in Calahonda near a sports center, supermarket, restaurants and bars. Just a few minutes to the charming Calahonda center.
This stunning villa comprises 3 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms (2 en-suites), and an open-plan Kitchen leading onto the spacious living and dining area with a beautiful electric chimney that warms up the entire house. You have direct access to a beautiful well-kept garden, pool, and lovely large garden and terraces throughout the house. The plot is 1218 m2, allowing you to build an attached bungalow or enlarge the house with 2-3 extra bedrooms, bathrooms, and living rooms if needed. The house was built in 1960, but the house was reformed by an architect in 2022. All paperwork is in order. 

Outside you have an abundance of space and a play area which also includes a private closed garage of 31m2. 

It is an incredibly nice house that must be seen!
