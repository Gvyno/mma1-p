Spectacular semi-detached house.

This incredible semi-detached house has been recently renovated with exquisite taste, turning it into a wonderful real estate gem.
It is a very spacious and bright house, given its strategic location and wonderful distribution.
The house has wonderful views of the sea, in addition to being on the seafront on one of the most famous beaches in Marbella.

The house has three very spacious and bright bedrooms, all of them, two full bathrooms, a spectacular kitchen open to the incredible living room, from which we access the wonderful private garden, with a jacuzzi and a chill out area, which after its renovation, puts the finishing touch. I pray to this house.
The semi-detached house consists of decoration with exquisite taste, which is included in the purchase of the home.

If you want to have a magazine house, don't miss this wonderful opportunity.
