Absolutely epic candle with explosive (and elevated) views to the sea, the valley, and the dawn!

Ideally located in La Mairena (Monte Elviria), with a plot of 2043 m2 with total privacy! The main floor (in the living room) is enhanced with very high ceilings of two heights and extends about 561 m2 built inside + terraces!

The villa has 5 bedrooms, 7 bathrooms, has a cinema room, office, gym, sauna, music room, games room, and much more. The kitchen opens to the pool and the beautiful views! The gardens are extensive, with swimming pool, jacuzzi, barbecue area, and views that can never be obstructed!

Among the many attributes there is also an underground garage for two cars, underfloor heating throughout the house, and a maximum quality of construction (included structure)!

A very special opportunity with enormous potential up!
