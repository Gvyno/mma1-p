Rare opportunity to find a villa with a plot of this size in this part of Nueva Andalucia!

An amazing family home with a very spacious plot of 1400 sqm within walking distance of several restaurants and shops. Upon entering you walk into a big and bright living room with an open plan kitchen and lots of natural light. There are 3 bedrooms and 3 bedrooms on the ground floor and on the first floor you find the master bedroom with an on suite bathroom and walk in closet. The basement is currently used as an entertainment room and storage but can be converted into a cinema or gym. The house is refurbished with high quality finishes, however the garden area has a lot of potential and adding social areas/bar/entertainment will add value to the property.
