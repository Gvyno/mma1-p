This beautifully appointed 126m2, 3 bedroom, 2 bathroom, first floor apartment is situated in the Miraflores area, in close proximity to the Miraflores Golf Course in lower Riviera del Sol, on the Mijas Costa. Located perfectly, a 15 minute walk brings you to El Bombo beach and the board walk that takes you East to La Cala de Mijas, and West, to the beaches of Calahonda and Cabopino. It's a 15 minute drive to Marbella and 30 minutes from Málaga Airport with fast access to the A7 and AP-7 motorways. There are local shops and restaurants just a three minute walk away. 

The apartment has been recently refurbished, with a focus on the bathrooms and kitchen, offering modern designs, materials and technology. There is a large sunny, South facing, covered terrace that can be accessed from two of the bedrooms, as well as the lounge. The kitchen is fully fitted, and refurbished to a high specification, equipped throughout with Bosch appliances. A special mention also to the work surfaces, made of Dekton, a high tech, modern material with low porosity and a scratch resistance equal to quartz, able to withstand the toughest wear and tear. There is also an installed water filter for fresh, filtered water. 

The entrance hallway is a generous size where the current owners are using it partly as an office area. This leads into a spacious, open plan dining and living area, accessing the sunny terrace. The apartment is situated on the corner of the building, with well established hedges, offering plenty of privacy from neighbours and pedestrians.

There are two bedrooms with fitted wardrobes and ceiling fans. These share one of the bathrooms. Entering the main bedroom, there is a large separate fitted wardrobe area, leading to the ensuite bathroom with shower over a fantastic sized, very modern bath. You will also find a modern vanity unit, toilet and bidet. Then further on is the main bedroom with its own ceiling fan and balcony access.
