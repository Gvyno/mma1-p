This is a lovely corner ground-floor 3-bedroom apartment in Casares del Sol.

The apartment is light and airy. It has three double bedrooms - all have fitted wardrobes. There are two bathrooms, one of which is ensuite. There is also a brand new, renovated,fully fitted kitchen with utility area.  One of the things that stands out about this apartment is the lovely terrace, which wraps around, creating a lovely sunny corner with space to dine al fresco or simply relax and sunbathe and enjoy the beautiful mountain and garden views.  There is the possibility to extend this terrace further and create a fabulous entertainment area.

The apartment comes with a private parking space and storage room. There is hot and cold air-conditioning throughout.

Casares del Sol is a beautifully maintained gated urbanisation with communal gardens and a large communal pool. The location of this urbanisation is unbeatable. Whilst being on the mountainside, surrounded by the mystical Casares mountains, you are just a 15 minute walk from the stunning Casares Coastline and the well-renowned &#039;La Sal&#039; Chringuito (beach restaurant). You can walk along the Casares coast to neighbouring Sabinillas with its many bars and restaurants and follow the promenade all the way to the Marina de la Duquesa and further afield.

If you are a keen golfer, you are across the road from Casares Golf and a five-minute walk, from the 6 star Finca Cortesin resort and clubhouse. Casares offers the perfect blend of old and new - within a 10-minute drive, you can be up in the whitewashed village of Casares. Casares is also known for its gastronomy - with lots of traditional &#039;ventas &#039; ( Spanish restaurants) all the way up the Casares road.

This would make the perfect home or holiday home. We thoroughly recommend viewing this apartment.
