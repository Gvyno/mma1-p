Gorgeous 2-bedroom ground floor apartment with large terrace and private garden in golf front residential in La Duquesa.

The living room is bright and spacious due to the large glass window doors that leads to the huge terrace and garden space. There is also a dedicated dinning space.

The covered terrace is ample and with plenty of space to fit a lounge area and a large dining table if wished and there will still be lots of space for different entertaining areas. One can enjoy unobstructed views to the surrounding areas and mountains with a lot of privacy as well as a very relaxing feeling.

The large garden is perfect for outdoor dining or BBQ for family and friends. Also ideal for families with kids or pets.

The 2 bedrooms are very large with fitted wardrobes. The master has an en-suite b bathroom with bathtub and there is a separated full family bathroom with shower.

The property is sold semi-furnished and includes a parking space and storage room in the price.

The property also has 2 large basements used as storage at the moment but that can be easily transformed in to a gym or cinema.

The location of the property is ideal, frontline golf and within around 15 minutes' walk to Duquesa Port and all the amenities: schools, bars, restaurants, health center, etc. Sotogrande Port is only 15 minutes' drive away and so is Estepona center.
