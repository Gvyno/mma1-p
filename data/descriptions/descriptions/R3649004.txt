Beautiful and rarely found is this wonderful 3 bedroom property in one of the most sought after urbanisations on the beach of San Pedro Alcantara. Easy flat walk to the beach and paseo where you will find many wining and dining facilities. A mere 20 minute walk will take you into the bustling Puerto Banus with its designer shops. The town center is a 5 minute walk away where you will find a busy town that has retained its Spanish roots. 
The urbanisation is secure and gated and is a private low rise development surrounded by lush tropical gardens. The apartment has a large open plan living and dining room which has patio doors leading onto a large terrace. The terrace is South facing and is partly covered ideal for the summer months. There are electric shutters to make this room a viable option also in the winter months. A gate leads to the communal gardens. There is a fully fitted kitchen with utility to one end. There are 3 bedrooms all of a good size, the master benefits from access to the main terrace and has an en suite bathroom. The other 2 bedrooms share a family shower room. In addition there is a guest cloakroom.
This is a super property for a family home with Laude being at the end of the road, Calpe a mere 15 minute walk away and Aloha and Swans a 10 minute car ride away. Many golf courses are also within a 5 minute drive. Additionally this property has the tourist license in place and has been running very well as a holiday rental which can also be taken over should the purchaser be interested. 
There is an underground parking space and a larger than average trastero included in the price. 
Dont delay to make your viewing today, properties in this location do not come on the market for sale often and is a true gem.
