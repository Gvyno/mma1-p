Villa situated in the heart of the Golf Valley. A welcoming entrance hall leads to the living room with a beautiful gabled ceiling and an impressive fireplace in the centre.

The open plan design of the house is evident with the fusion of kitchen and living room opening onto a dreamlike patio with covered porch, BBQ area and lovely pool area. On this level there are two further bedrooms and the master suite with dressing room and views of the pool and La Concha mountain.
Downstairs amenities include two convenient bedrooms, laundry room, garage, and a unique second living/entertaining area styled with wooden floors.
