A perfectly situated townhouse only 2 min walk from the beach of Puerto Banus and San Pedro.
The house has 2 floor, on the ground floor we have a 30 m2 terrace overlooking the pool and a nice living area with an open fireplace.
also the kitchen will be found on this floor, going up the stairs we have 4 bedrooms, 2 ensuite and the other 2 share a large bathroom.
There are lots of wardrobes in the bedrooms and with some adjustments the bedrooms and bathrooms can even be extended, also the kitchen could easily be converted to a modern open plan
kitchen area, this gated complex has so many advantages, the beach is a stone throw away, there is a Carrefour large supermarkt walking distance, also you can walk to all the beach restaurants and even to San Pedro town or Puerto Banus.
There is public transport close by as well for people without a car, but the property comes with a garage space as well.
The community fees are fair, all in all an amazing investment as there are hardly any beach side properties for sale in this area below 1 M euro.
