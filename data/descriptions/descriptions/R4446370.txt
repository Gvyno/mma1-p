NEW TO THE MARKET 

This property does have an LPO so can be rented short term in the tourism market.

2 Bedroom, 1 Bathroom apartment with Stunning panoramic Sea views.

This apartment, is located in El Faro in a very quiet Cul-De-Sac road just a couple of minutes drive to the beach, or a 10 minutes walk through the wonderful surrounding forest down to the Beach.

The apartment, is on the top floor however you enter the property at street level, so no stairs to climb .

As you enter, to the left side is a fully fitted fully equipped kitchen. The living area is really bright and airy due to the large glass patio doors leading on to the covered terrace.

From the terrace and living room, there are the most fantastic, panoramic Sea views.

Both of the bedrooms are double in size, and have fitted wardrobes. The master bedroom also has glass patio doors leading onto the terrace with the same breath taking Sea views.

The local supermarket and Restaurants are just a few minutes walk away.

We really recommend viewings on this property, as it will not be on the market for very long.
