Let us introduce 'Love at first sight'
Imagine paradise - Remove the snake from the picture and you´ve got it right here. 
This, ladies and gentlemen is beauty per definition. A large, elevated and let´s not forget refurbished house with a garden that reminds you of the garden of Eden, but the garden of Eden did not have a large pool and definitely not these views that are beyond belief with The Mediterranean Sea, Gibraltar and Africa in the background. It´s a religious moment, that we can promise. 
The layout, the quality materials used, the furniture - You don´t need to change a thing. This is what you call a home with capital H.
We could probably write a book to describe this property, but as the saying goes - A picture says more than a thousand words, so please study the photos and watch the video. When you have fallen in love - call us to schedule a viewing.
