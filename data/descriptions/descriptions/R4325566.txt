Patience is a virtue, they say. They also say that good things will come to those who wait. Well, the wait is over, because finally we can present a lovely southwest facing groundfloor apartment in excellent condition in sought after Jardines de Manilva. Only 400 metres from the beach and yet not disturbed by traffic, this is a gem among gems. Walking distance to the marina of La Duquesa is a bonus! Three bedrooms, two bathrooms.
We have been waiting so long for this location to come to market and now someone´s prayers have been listened to, because here it is. This beauty will NOT be on the market for long so seize the moment whilst it´s here.
