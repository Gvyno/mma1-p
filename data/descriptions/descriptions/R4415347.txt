Great value detached villa located within a private gated community in Benahavis. This attractive villa boasts great views of the surrounding area and is just a short drive to the bustling town of Marbella and its famous Marina of Puerto Banús plus a 15-minute drive to the coastal town of Estepona. This spacious two-bedroom villa can very easily be converted into a three-bedroom property. The community offers an array of onsite facilities including a large indoor heated pool, five outdoor swimming pools, a chiringuito beach and BBQ bar, tennis court, paddle and squash courts, a gymnasium, Jacuzzi, and immaculately kept gardens. Upon entering this stylish and modern villa you find the open plan lounge with a working fireplace and dining area, a fully fitted kitchen, and a utility room. From the living room, there is access to a wooden decked area, perfect for BBQs, al fresco dining, and a small private swimming pool. Two good-sized double bedrooms, both with en suite shower rooms, fitted wardrobes, and a full bathroom with access to a beautiful garden with a fully automated irrigation system, which has been designed with low maintenance in mind. The coast is just a ten-minute drive away, and Marbella even less, this lovely villa is an absolute bargain that is unlikely to be on the market for long!
