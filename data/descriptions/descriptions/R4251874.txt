Beautifully modernised two bedroom, two bathroom corner garden apartment on very popular residencial complex close to golf and restaurants. 

This bright and airy ground floor apartment is an ideal home for extended holidays or permanent residence. Its spacious interior has been tastefully renovated from top to bottom to remain in keeping with the architectural style of the complex while enabling the current owners to benefit from a more modern interior. 

As you walk through the front door, you can see through the living and dining area to the mature private corner garden which has plenty of room for children or pets to play. It's also overlooking one of the two community pools and surrounding garden area.  

The kitchen has been reconfigured to improve flow through the apartment and create a more open plan space between there and the garden - ideal for family life and entertaining. Both bathrooms have been modernised (one with a walk in shower and the other with a bath) and both have windows for extra ventilation. Air conditioning (hot and cold) has already been installed in the property and the windows have been replaced to better insulate the apartment.

Included in the sale is an underground parking space.

A well presented apartment in move in condition.
