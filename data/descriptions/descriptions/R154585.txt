This is an attractive home for a buyer located within a 7 minute walk to the beach and even closer to numerous restaurants and bars.  A residential area, there is a feeling of tranquility and with the design of the urbanisation it is really like a typical Spanish Pueblo and yet only 10 minutes from Marbella.  Conveniently located for both Spanish and International schools too.  This price also includes a garage space in the Fairways Urbanisation across the road offering secure parking which is unusual for Urb Pueblo Andaluz
