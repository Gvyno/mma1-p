Stunning views from this villa in Benahavís Hills.

This beautiful home is located on a dead-end street in the complex, which makes it very quiet and private, plus because you have no other houses in front, this house offers spectacular views from every level and room.

As you arrive a private two-car parking space welcomes you while looking straight to the mountains in Benahavís and the Mediterranean Sea. On this level, we find the main entrance that leads us to the stairway and a lift, which connects all floors in this property.

One floor lower we have a large living area with a fireplace, connected to a dining area next to the open-plan kitchen. You can enjoy meals at any moment of the day in any of the two terraces on this level and you also have a guest toilet.

Further down we find the three en-suite bedrooms, the master with access to a private terrace and the second and third with balconies, all of these with beautiful views in the same direction. The main bathroom enjoys a lovely walk-in shower and a private sauna.

On the bottom floor, there is a fantastic entertaining area with a full kitchen and access to the garden and pool area with an outdoor shower. This space has been utilized to maximize the storage and living areas. The garden is a very well-used space with a lounge, dining area, and a good-size pool on the side which also makes it private.
