A top floor apartment in excellent condition with two bedrooms, open plan kitchen and panoramic views beyond belief. Low fees is a bonus. Currently there is one pool on the premises, but there are plans for yet another pool, indoor cinema, social club, restaurant, paddle and tennis courts and more.  This is value for your money, ladies and gentlemen.
