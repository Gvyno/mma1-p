It includes an underground garage for two cars.
Located in a residential area with quiet streets, nearby schools, nurseries, the El Mirador paddle tennis club, and the Monte Paraíso Country Club golf club, the villa is also conveniently close to the center of Marbella.
Four of the villas face southeast, while the remaining four face southwest—each offering magnificent sea views.
A great opportunity to live in a tranquil area close to all amenities, in a sophisticated and unique residence.
