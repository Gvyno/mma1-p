Really nice groundfloor apartment in Rock Bay II, the further uphill, quiet well established luxury urbanisation with really nice pool, gardens and padel court. Great location when commuting to Gibraltar for example. 40 minutes from Marbella. The Price includes parking and storage. Good size apartment with 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms. The master bedroom has an en-suite 4piece bathroom. High ceilings and safety electric blinds installed on all Windows. Also has the air con machine installed, integrated in the house for all different modes. We have the keys, easy to view. Great holiday apartment or for holiday rentals, but also a great property if you like to be in a quiet area. The views are not open to this property, but you are close to the pool.
