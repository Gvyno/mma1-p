Beautiful restored 19th century house.
For the reform, original materials from Malaga have been used, such as the cobblestones or the mud of the bathrooms and the original terrace of the tiles of Vélez Málaga.
The fountain takes advantage of the freshness of the water and communicates with a wind tower that is on the terrace (original Iranian system) and thus lowers the interior temperature by several degrees.
