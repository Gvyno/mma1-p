Nice and cozy semi-detached house in PLAYA PARAISO, a beautiful typical Andalusian-style urbanization on the beach.
It is made up of three floors where we can find on the ground floor a living-dining room, a fully open kitchen, a pantry and a toilet. On the first floor we find two bedrooms and a bathroom and on the second floor we find a huge solarium.
Ideal as a second residence due to its proximity to the sea.
The enclosure is completely closed with beautiful and well-kept gardens and a huge pool where we can see the impressive Mediterranean Sea as if we were inside it.
DO NOT FORGET TO VISIT IT!!!!!
