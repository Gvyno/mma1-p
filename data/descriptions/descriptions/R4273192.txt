This property is a rare find and presents a unique opportunity to own an outstanding plot in a highly desirable location. There are very few properties like this left with a Banus postcode but in a quiet residential area! With a south facing plot of just over 1900m² , this house is perfect for full renovation and a huge return on investment. The house at the moment is a lovely old Spanish, single storey house with beautiful terracotta tiles, Andalucian arches and a stunning garden that is literally an oasis within Marbella and Puerto Banus. The plot is flat, with a large and extra deep pool at the bottom of the garden. There are lots of different fruit trees on the plot that bear fruit year round (fig, avocado, peach, nispero, persimon, mandarin, plum, olive, banana, pomegranate and even grape vines!). There is also a pond with turtles and fish.  This property has been in the same family for 4 generations and is now up for sale. This really is an extra special plot, second line to the beach and walking distance into Puerto Banus and San Pedro. It would be perfect for investors looking for a good return on investment or for a family looking for an amazing home hidden in lush tropical gardens within a prime location of Marbella.
