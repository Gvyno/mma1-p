Beautiful and spacious villa located in a sought after area, a ten minute walk from the center of Marbella. In its surroundings we can locate schools, a playground, Mercadona, a restaurant, as well as a 5-star hotel, two minutes from the bus station, as well as perfectly communicated with the entrance of the highway both towards Puerto Banús and towards Málaga. The house was built in the year 2000 and in addition to valuing its design and qualities, such as hot and cold air conditioning, as well as underfloor heating throughout the house, independent in each room. Iroko wood closures with Climalit windows and automatic and security blinds. Infinity pool. Among many other no less interesting details, I would emphasize its wonderful open views towards the sea and the mountains. House composed of three levels of which the lower one is a large space of 300 m². Stately access to the house. It is worth the visit.
