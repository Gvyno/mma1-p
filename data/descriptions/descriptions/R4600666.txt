Located on a plot of 3,212 m2, this land is classified as sectorized and planned urbanizable land, with a specific designation as a Community Equipment Zone. Designed for social benefit, its utilization and use are intended for social facilities, offering extraordinary potential for the development of enriching projects.

The maximum buildable surface of 3,212 m2 allows for the realization of an ambitious vision that has been carefully studied. This land has been considered for three possible uses, each of which has been meticulously planned:

Senior Apartments: A proposal that includes assisted living units with a Day Center, fostering a safe and welcoming environment for the elderly.

Geriatric Residence: Designed with a hospital focus, this option offers facilities that meet the highest standards of care and comfort for the geriatric population.

Student Residence: A vibrant alternative that seeks to provide an optimal space for the academic and personal development of students.

Each option contemplates a building of three floors in height, in addition to an underground floor, strictly complying with the Community Equipment regulations by maintaining a separation of 5.00 meters from the boundaries. This approach ensures a harmonious integration into the surrounding environment.

This initial proposal serves as a solid foundation for the future development of the project, incorporating formal, functional, and aesthetic design that will adapt to the specific needs of the promoter. Additionally, the context of the surroundings is taken into account, ensuring that the project not only meets the highest standards but also integrates harmoniously and sustainably into the surrounding community.
