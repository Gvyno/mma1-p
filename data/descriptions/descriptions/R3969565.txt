Almost every square meter of this plot has fantastic views of the coast and in one location there are views that spread from Puerto Banus to Gibraltar.
Houses : There are "out-houses and sheds" on the plot that until recently were used by a goatherdsman. Planning to build 250m2 would almost certainly be granted provided the building also allowed for "use with animals" complimentary to a green-belt environment.
Access: There is a dirt track road to the property. The nearest asphalt road is about 1000m away in Camino Nicola Alto.
Water : There is a small well on the property.
