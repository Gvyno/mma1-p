Looking for your new dream home? 

Then look no further! This beautiful charming house has everything you want for your new Spanish dream home. 

This extraordinary 3-bedroom house has spectacular views of the Mediterranean with views as far as Estepona and Marbella. It is located in a quiet residential urbanisation with a community pool maintained to a high standard. 

This home is ready to walk in and start living straight away. Before you even enter the property, you have a private undercover driveway. Once through the door to the right is a large fully equipped kitchen. 

On this ground floor is also a guest bathroom which then leads into a large open-plan living and dining room complete with an open fireplace (not that you will need it much) 

Natural light floods in through the terrace doors, leading out onto to large outdoor terrace where you can enjoy specular views for your outside dining, BBQs or simply catching the sunny rays Spain has to offer. 

As we move up through the house, you will find 3 large bedrooms, one of which has an en-suite, and 2 of which have additional terraces for that extra personal space. 

On the third level of this house, there is an additional space, which could be converted into a fourth bedroom. Here you will also find 2 additional terraces, one of which houses a large hot tub perfect for those chillout moments whilst taking in the views of Sierra Bermeja. 

To move into this perfect family home, you are only a short 6-minute walk from the local town of Manilva Pueblo and then a 20-minute walk downhill to San Luis de Sabinillas and Puerto de Duquesa where you can immerse yourself in all the activities our local area has to offer. 

We hold keys in the office and are ready to show you this beautiful home at your convenience
