A charming southeast facing country property just 5 minutes from the centre of Alhaurín de la Torre, strategically built in the centre of a large plot of nearly 6,000m² with several fruit trees, such as avocado, medlar, orange, lemon, quince and lime. The house is in perfect condition and benefits from underfloor heating, wooden interior carpentry and Climalit aluminium exterior carpentry with mosquito screens.

The entrance to the house is on the ground floor via the spacious and luminous hallway, whose ceiling height has allowed the construction of a wooden mezzanine floor, creating a very special atmosphere. To the left is a large living room with fireplace and direct access to the porch, which surrounds almost the entire property, a huge, charming rustic style kitchen with dining room, utility room and direct access to the porch and the impressive swimming pool. To the right and taking advantage of the space under the staircase, there is a storage room. The hallway leads to the two bedrooms and two bathrooms (one of them ensuite). The master bedroom has a dressing room, and the second bedroom has a built-in wardrobe.

Upstairs there is a bedroom and an enclosed terrace which can have a variety of uses. Additionally, there is a bathroom with shower and another good size enclosed terrace, which offers more space for multipurpose use, just like the other terrace. This whole floor benefits from wonderful panoramic views.

Outside there is a large swimming pool and garden, all on a flat plot of land. There is also a small house currently used for storage (but which could easily be converted into a guest house) a covered parking area for several vehicles, a surface water well, irrigation water storage, and a water storage tank. A community well provides the drinking water.
