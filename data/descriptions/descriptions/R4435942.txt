This move-in ready beautifully furnished apartment is located in La quinta (golf) Benahavis.

When you walk into the apartment you immediately enter an open space. On the left you can find an open kitchen with cooking island, dining table and living area with fireplace.  
In the living room you can slide the windows completely open so that it is one with your terrace. Both from the living room, terrace and bedrooms you have a beautiful sea view and views of the mountains and the beautiful communal pool. The terrace is partly covered. 

The apartment has a separate laundry room/storage room, guest toilet, 3 bedrooms with fitted closets and 2 bathrooms. The master bedroom has a large bathroom and separate dressing room.

Also from the bedrooms you can enter the spacious terrace and garden. The terrace and garden is south/west orientated. But even in the morning you have some sun in the beautiful garden. 
The garden is fully screened and is maintained weekly by the community. 

It is a luxuriously finished apartment with home automation system, alarm and everything you can imagine. 
The apartment is part of the Real de la Quinta Residential Country Club Resort project.
