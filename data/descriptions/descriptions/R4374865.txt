A rare opportunity to purchase a frontline golf plot with license approved.

Situated in the best residential area of Nueva Andalucia, overlooking los Naranjos golf course with views to La Concha and the golf course.

The basic project, execution project and building license has been paid for and is included in the price.

The project is for a modern contemporaray luxury villa with a grand entrance, high ceilings and a basement with cinema room, gym, indoor heated pool and a spa.

Some earth movement and excavations have already been done and also a retaining wall and some work on the sewage connections. All services connected.

There is about 250,000 euros that the buyer saves since this is the value of architect project fees, building permission, excavation, walls, geotechnical study, and pruning of trees.

In addition, there are no plots available in Nueva Andalucia, and even less on the first line of golf, and even less where you can start to be build tomorrow.

Building density of 0,20 m2/m2, the project contemplates a basement of 326 m2 although this could be made larger.

So in total the villa would have at least 688 m2.

Definitely a rare opportunity.
