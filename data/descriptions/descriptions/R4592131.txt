¡Welcome to your next home! This little house is very close to Torreblanca Beach, just outside Fuengirola! The atmosphere of the area where the townhouse is located will transport you to the classic ambiance of the white mountain villages, hence the name of the Puebla Blanca community. And by this, I also mean that to access it, you'll need to climb some stairs.

The property is distributed over two floors and includes three bedrooms, a toilet on the ground floor, and a bathroom on the floor where the 3 bedrooms are located.

Outside, at the front of the house, there is a cozy terrace from where you can see the sea between the buildings, and at the back, there is a patio of approximately 10 m2. In the living-dining room, you can enjoy an exceptional space to bask in the morning sun.

Additionally, it features an exclusive communal pool area where you can cool off during the warm summer days. Within walking distance, you'll have access to train and bus connections, the beach, local restaurants, and, for activity enthusiasts, Torreblanca's own paddle tennis court.
