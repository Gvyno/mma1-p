This lovely elevated ground floor apartment in one of our top selling urbanizations Nueva Alcaidesa is a must see.  2 Bedrooms, 2 Bathrooms. With 90m 2 of livable space, over 40m2 of outside space, Sea and Golf views, this property offers exactly what the vast majority of buyers are seeking. There is a lovely patio that offers morning sun, and a half covered, half uncovered south west terrace offering both an escape from the sun on one side, or a sun trap for those sun seekers on the other. Glass curtains allow the covered portion to be like a winter lounge. All bathrooms have been renovated, and the kitchen is immaculate. In all, with the location so close to Alcaidesa golf club, the incredible investment in the area with the new Hacienda Hotel, and the quality of this property, this is a great deal. A motivated seller who will sell as seen including all furniture!
