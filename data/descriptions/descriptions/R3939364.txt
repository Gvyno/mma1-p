Block with 9 flats in the historic centre of Ronda. 

In the city centre of Ronda, we find a large block consisting of 9 apartments. Four apartments are on the ground floor and 5 apartments on the first floor. Some of the flats have a roof terrace with fantastic views of the village and the Sierra de las Nieves.

The property is in need of complete renovation but is ideal for an apartment project, boutique hotel or to make a stately home in the centre of Ronda. 

The location is unbeatable, right next to Ronda's main church and town hall.
