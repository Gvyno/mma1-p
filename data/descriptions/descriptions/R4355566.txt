Charming house in a beautiful Mediterranean-style community, with two large swimming pools. Close to San Pedro de Alcántara, the Guadalmina shopping center, the Atalaya and Guadalmina golf courses and a step away from many shops, bars and restaurants. 800 meters from the beach

The House has 2 floors.

In the first, the first thing we see when entering is a large patio with a barbecue, where you can enjoy the sun all day, from which we access a spacious living-dining room with a fireplace open to the kitchen and a guest toilet.

The first floor is made up of two bedrooms and a bathroom.

From the main bedroom we access a large terrace with unobstructed views towards the shell of Marbella.
