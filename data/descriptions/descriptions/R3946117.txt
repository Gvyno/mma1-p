Commercial premises in the center of Benahavís town.

Spacious local, which, given its size, offers different possibilities, having in its past housed a hamburger restaurant and at the same time a leisure bar where customers alternated nights, being very popular on Sundays as it brought together a great soccer fan to see in their multiple screens, it is in a very good condition with a valid license.

It represents a good investment, one of its greatest values is due to the location in the heart of the city.
