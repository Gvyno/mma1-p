Presenting this brand new turnkey villa located near the center of Estepona, an architectural gem currently under construction, with work starting in January 2024 and expected completion in the spring of 2025.

Inspired by the surrounding natural environment and built to the highest standards of quality, this villa ensures not only a luxury residence but also a private and exclusive retreat. Strategically oriented from south to west, it maximizes sunlight exposure and panoramic views.

The modern and contemporary design of the villa unfolds across multiple levels, including a main floor, a lower underground level, and a solarium.

On the main floor, you'll find the living and dining area with an open-plan kitchen (yet to be chosen). From here, there's direct access to a spacious covered and uncovered terrace, an exquisite garden, and a private pool. Additionally, this floor houses the en-suite master bedroom with a walk-in closet and terrace access, as well as two guest bedrooms sharing a bathroom and a guest toilet.

The lower underground level offers an open space, ideal for creating another bedroom with a private bathroom or an entertainment area, along with a garage for one vehicle.

With a prime location near all amenities, the beach, and several renowned golf courses, this villa offers the perfect combination of luxury, comfort, and convenience. The center of Estepona and its lively port are just minutes away, ensuring a dynamic and sophisticated lifestyle for its future residents.
