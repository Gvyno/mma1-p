Excellent finca that we find in one of the most wonderful places in the Costa del Sol, in El Chorro, next to the famous Caminito del Rey. A must-see place for all visitors to the city. The property is located just a few meters from one of the reservoirs and is distributed in three independent houses and a restaurant very visited. Ideal for rent, as an idyllic place to live and have at the same time an income for its potential. Virtual tour and floor plan available.
