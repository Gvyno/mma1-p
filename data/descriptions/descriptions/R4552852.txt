Nice apartment, well renovated, taking advantage of all the space. The terrace has a fantastic south orientation, providing lots of natural light to the entire apartment. Being a spacious terrace, the terrace has been divided in two, leaving one half as a possible extra bedroom in case of visitors and the second half where you can sit in the sun. It is completely glazed to enjoy it all year round. The bathroom has also been completely renovated with a modern Italian shower and has a window to the outside. The kitchen has also been used to its maximum by adding furniture to accommodate the washing machine and dishwasher. It is semi open to the dining room but could easily be opened completely if desired. In both the living room and the bedroom, the fireplaces have been covered giving a warmer and more modern appearance. There is an extra closet in the hallway for more storage. The community offers a community pool. Parking is communal on the street right in front of the apartment.
The location is fantastic, just a step away from the beautiful La Luna beach in Calahonda and all services and restaurants are within walking distance. Both Marbella and Fuengirola are about 10 minutes away by car and Malaga airport is about 25 minutes away.
