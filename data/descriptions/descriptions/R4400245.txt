Magnificent townhouse in the golf course. Very comfortable dining room with a cozy fireplace and exit to the gardens of the Golf. A very well equipped kitchen. Upstairs there are two large bedrooms with bathrooms en suite. It has a large communal pool where you can spend pleasant moments.
Enjoy the Casa Club del Golf Torrequebrada, just in front of the urbanization. Very close there are schools, padel club, gas station, hospitals ...
