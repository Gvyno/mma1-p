OPPORTUNITY FOR FAMILIES AND GOLF LOVERS
You may identify with one of these situations: 
1.- You have children or are thinking of having them and you dream of a property where your family can grow, where the children feel free to play within a gated urbanisation with plenty of outdoor space. You value the convenience of having a supermarket, an international school and soon a small shopping centre nearby, as well as having access to the beach just a few minutes away.
2.- You are a golf lover and are enthusiastic about the idea of living close to the best golf courses so that you can go out and play without having to spend too much time in the car.
Then this is the opportunity to buy this very special ground floor apartment.
By buying this ground floor apartment you will be buying the following: 
- A large and bright living room where you can receive your friends, organise meetings, get together with the family, lie down to watch TV, enjoy the quiet evenings. 
- Large terrace where you can sit and read, grow your own plants, have breakfast in the morning or do your daily exercise routine. 
- Spacious, bright and very comfortable kitchen with everything you need to prepare your meals. It also has a large serving hatch that opens onto the living room and is a delight when hosting dinner parties with family or friends.
- Three very spacious and quiet bedrooms with large wardrobes where you can store all your clothes. The master bedroom has a very comfortable and intimate dressing room.
- Three exterior bathrooms, two of them inside the room. 
- A ventilated and illuminated space thanks to its corner location that also allows you to enjoy a wider view.
And also:
- Security as it is located within a gated community with 24-hour surveillance and also has a privileged location that makes it be in the front line of the surveillance office (but not so close as to compromise privacy).
- Spacious and comfortable storage room where you can store bicycles, golf bags and where you can have several shelves and a small cupboard. It is located right next to the two parking spaces with TESLA charger for electric cars. 
- A luxury urbanization with well-kept gardens, two outdoor swimming pools: one for adults who shy away from the noise and another for children and families who enjoy summer afternoons playing games. It also has an equipped gym, jacuzzi, sauna and indoor pool so that taking care of yourself and dedicating time to yourself is more at hand than ever. 
And of course:
The chance to enjoy the lifestyle you dream of having.
