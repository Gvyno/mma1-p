Marvellous plot of approx. 4.500 catastral m2 with completely free 180 degrees sea views, panoramic mountain and countryside forest views at one of the best spots within the Monte Mayor 24/7 secured urbanisation. 

The plot includes full land preparation for starting construction, to be delivered with terminated ecowall and a project signed by the renowned Villaroel Torrico arquitects. The projected contemporary villa with infinity pool, can measure up to around 1500-2000 m2 including basements and garages. South orientated with views as well to west and east. Extra outside garages can be easily added as the land allows subterranean garages to be constructed at the side of the access road on own land. This feature will please all investment calculations, offering a very interesting investment per m2 to construct. A building licence can be obtained within three months in Benahavis.

One of the very best plots still available in Monte Mayor!
