Newly built townhouse with amazing sea views in Torreblanca.
We are proud to present this unique townhouse in one of the most popular areas of Fuengirola.
The location is perfect in lower Torreblanca with just a five minute walk to the beach, and all the restaurants along the Paseo Maritimo promenade. 
The house is has three bedrooms, kitchen, living room and 2 very large terrace areas. From the living room you have large glass windows that can be opened up to
a lovely terrace with room for a large dining table and a cozy seating area. 
In all bathrooms there there is underfloor heating. The terraced house has three large bedrooms, all of which have sea views and intergrated AC. The master
bedroom has an en-suite bathroom and there are two more bathrooms. 

The most spectacular thing about this townhouse is the wonderful large roof terrace, which offers the most amazing panoramic
view of the sea and the mountains, and with enough space to even potentially make an outdoor kitchen & even an area for a jacuzzi (water & electricity for this is already pre-installed). 
The house has a perfect location facing south, and has sun from morning to evening. Furthermore, this amazing house also has its own private garden of 39 sqm.

A large private storage room and private parking space in the garage is included. In the common areas there is also a large
communal infinity pool with fantastic sea views as well as a gym, a pool table and a table tennis table.
