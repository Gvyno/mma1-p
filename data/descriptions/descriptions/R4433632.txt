This charming detached villa is like a little oasis at a walking distance to the amenities and the beach with its own 370 m2 plot, its 8m x 4m HEATED pool and its tropical plants surrounding the house. It's one of those property that will give you that good vibes just walking in. It offers a lovely sunny terrace next to the pool with space for several sunbeds, a BBQ, an outside shower, a drive for a couple of cars, lots of storeroom close with electric shutters and a front lawn. The garden has pedestrian gates and double gates to enter the driveway. The accommodation comprises a spacious lounge-diner, a semi-open fully fitted kitchen with integral appliances and a direct access to the back of the house and with an outside utility area for the washing machine and dryer closed with electric shutters, two double bedrooms, one with a newly-refurbished ensuite shower room with underfloor heating and a separate family bathroom with heated towel rail. All windows and doors are double-glazed. There is also an outside shower with hot and cold water for the cooler months of swimming.

The lounge and both bedrooms have new air-conditioning and heating units and the pool is heated by a recently fitted electric air source heat pump.

Running costs are extremely low as a 4kW solar system has been installed, which keeps the electricity bills between 10€ and 40€ per month throughout the year! 

There is also a rooftop solarium with storage cupboards, where you can enjoy the sun until it sets!

The villa is located in a quiet residential street, within 5 mins walk to the beach, shops, bars, banks, some excellent restaurants and large supermarkets.

It is perfect to live and enjoy your pool all year round or of course as a vacation home prepared for summer and winter.
