2 bedroom apartment on the top floor of a small building of only 3 apartments.

Located only a short walk away for the centre of Benahavis village and with stunning views of the mountains. This bright apartment was built to a high standard in 2009.

This home consists of 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms, a good size living/dining room, a fully fitted modern kitchen and a large terrace with panoramic views.

This is a fantastic full time home next to all the amenities in Benahavís or an easy lock-and-leave holiday home in one of the most sought-after locations in La Costa del Sol.
