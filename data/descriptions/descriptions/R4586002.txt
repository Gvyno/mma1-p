Steps from the beach, between Guadalmina Baja and San Pedro Alcántara. 

In a property investment, what determines the value of the property above all else is the location, and in this property it is all about location, location and location. 

Steps away from the beach, in the exclusive area of Lindavista, between Guadalmina Baja and San Pedro Alcántara, the villa enjoys one of the most sought-after residential areas in Marbella.

Upon entering the property, the spacious living/dining room is highlighted by a fireplace, a space that communicates harmoniously with a large porch of 30 m2.  The porch opens onto a mature tropical garden, in the centre of which is the swimming pool.

On the ground floor there is a bedroom with en suite bathroom and a guest toilet. The kitchen is large and bright, fully equipped, functional and opens onto the back garden surrounded by fruit trees. 

The first floor reveals a careful design and an ideal distribution of space, with three bedrooms and two bathrooms. The master bedroom also has a large and comfortable dressing room and a private terrace overlooking the lush garden.

The basement, with a generous 145 square metres, provides additional space for a variety of needs, whether for storage, a private gym or even the ability to customise according to your preferences.

Security is a priority in this villa, with the presence of an alarm system that provides peace of mind and protection to its residents.
