This bar/restaurant is very interesting. It could potentially be changed to residential property. This would need to be confirmed. there are several other ground floor premises which have been allowed to do this, so very interesting as a project. It has 200m2 and access from both sides of the premises onto 2 distinct roads. A very busy residential area very close to central Fuengirola and also to the Water Park and Myramar complex. Could maybe be turned into another commercial activity too.
