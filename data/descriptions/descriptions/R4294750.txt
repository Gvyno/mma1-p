Wonderful Finca in Estepona

Located in the skirts of the iconic Sierra Bermeja mountain in Estepona, we find the Finca El Algarrobal. 

Only a 5-minute drive from the town centre and in an elevated position with fantastic panoramic views we have this 30.000m2 plot surrounded by nature. 

The plot has a beautiful driveway which leads to the main house. 
The property has a lovely rustic Andalusian style and its 235m2 is distributed in the following way: 

As we access the property we find a welcoming hall and an ample living room with beautiful wooden beams and a fireplace. 

Separately there is a dining area, a fully equipped kitchen with a wood-burning oven, a laundry, an office and two bedrooms which share a bathroom.

On the first floor, we find the master bedroom with an en suite bathroom and a second bedroom and another bathroom. 

And finally, on floor -1, there is a wine cellar and a room that can be used as a gymnasium, home cinema or a fifth bedroom. 

In the outdoor area, there is a 35m2 terrace with a barbecue area, a swimming pool and a toilet. 

There are 2 other constructions in the plot that add up to 250m2, are used as warehouses to keep tools and cars and have the potential to have some stables for horses as the land is ideal for those purposes. On top of these buildings, there is a system of photovoltaic panels which reduce the overall electricity costs of the Finca.

There is also a large water deposit to fill from the river and use to water the vast variety of fruit and vegetables that we find along the Finca. 

This Finca is a must-see, as it is a very unique property surrounded by the magic and nature of Sierra Bermeja and only a few minutes away from all kinds of services.
