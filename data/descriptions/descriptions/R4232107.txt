Lovely 1-bedroom apartment with terrace and sea and mountain views in Las Lomas, Estepona.

The kitchen is independent and recently renovated. It has a breakfast bar and lovely views from the large window.

The living room is large and bright, with big windows and glass doors to access to the terrace, which allows plenty of sunlight. The terrace is large enough and enjoys stunning unobstructed sea views.

There is also a convenient guest toilet at the entrance of the apartment.

The bedroom is spacious with large fitted wardrobes and direct access to the terrace. The bathroom is en-suite with bathtub.

There is plenty of communal parking space.

The location is great, in a quiet yet well communicated area with many amenities around. The closest beach is just 3 minutes' drive away (a mere 10 minutes' walk) and Estepona Centre is just 10 minutes' drive away. There are plenty of Golf courses and International Schools in the area too.
