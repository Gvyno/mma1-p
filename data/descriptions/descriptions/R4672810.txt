This is a very spacious and recently refurbished one bedroom apartment located in Torrenueva and just 250 metres from the beach at El Bombo. It is ideal for those who don't want to rely on a car to get to the beach, supermarket or dine out.
Recently refurbished with new windows, doors, floors, an upgraded kitchen and tiling in the bathroom, this south facing apartment also has a lovely sunny terrace from which to enjoy those great sea views and over the pool and gardens.
