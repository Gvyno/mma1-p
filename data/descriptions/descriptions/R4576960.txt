Close to the beach penthouse apartment with good sized bedroom, bathroom and spacious sitting room. Beautiful open sea views. The apartment is light and airy and is quiet being on the top floor. There is a large communal pool and gardens. Parking is off street inside the gated complex. The location is superb. A quiet street but only a short walk to Torremolinos centre and the sea. Great as a holiday rental of a holiday home. low maintenance and not expensive.
