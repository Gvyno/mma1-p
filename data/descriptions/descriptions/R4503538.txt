This is a bright and charming ground floor apartment in the well maintained ,and sought after, community of Los Naranjos de Marbella. This 2-bedroom apartment has a beautiful and spacious sitting room come dining room with bay windows overlooking the gardens and a fireplace for cosy winter evenings and A/C throughout for the hot summer months. The terrace leads straight off from the sitting room and has a large sofa/chill out area. The beauty of this terrace is not only its size, and the fact it can be used year round, but that it has private access straight into the gardens and pool area. This makes it ideal for families with children who can come and go as they please making the communal pool and gardens feel like an extension of the property. The kitchen is fully fitted with a handy utility room. Both bathrooms are marble throughout, one has a walk in shower while the other has a bath/shower. 
Furniture is optional. This is a perfect "lock up and leave" holiday apartment and would make a fantastic rental property due to its close location to Puerto Banus. Rental properties here enjoy year round success simply due to location and the fact that the urbanisation, Los Naranjos, has an authentic  Andalucian charm that isn't seen in modern properties today. The area feels like a village allowing you to meander through the little streets passing swimming pools, fountains, water features, beautiful Andalucian tiling and statues all wrapped up in mature tropical gardens.

The running costs of this property are low: Community fees are €135/m. IBI : €950/yr
