Introducing an incredible corner semi-detached chalet with community garden located in a central area, just a few meters away from all the shopping centers, shops, and services of Sitio de Calahonda. And the best part is, it's only 350 meters away from the beach!
This charming house consists of two floors plus solarium. On the first floor, you'll find a spacious living-bedroom, a fully equipped kitchen, an additional bedroom, a bathroom, and direct access to the beautiful gardens and the communal pool. The house has a first occupation licence.  Part of the garden can be fenced as it is a corner house. 
The second floor boasts two spacious bedrooms, each with a small private terrace, and a family bathroom en suite. Moreover, the ample solarium offers sun throughout the day and partial sea views, which is simply spectacular. It has as well an storage room.
The house needs updating of bathrooms, kitchen and exterior paintwork, but has great potential!!!!.
