A fantastic luxury villa with sea views, just a few minutes from Benalmadena Pueblo. The construction of the property has been personally supervised by the owners using the highest quality materials. Everything has been meticulosly planned and thought through to make this a luxurious and comfortable home. An Internal lift, pre-installation for sound and video, perimeter and internal alarm system, kitchen 'cool  draws' and a stunning ehtrance hall makes this property stand out from the rest.
