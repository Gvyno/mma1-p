The property is a large two-story townhouse with a large patio out back. With the option to add 2 more floors and independent access to the back street. A lot of potential for a large home, with a garage and double access or two independent houses.

The house has all the details of the town houses of the 90s. Located in one of the streets with lots of light due to its orientation to the south.

On the ground floor of the house you will find a spacious entrance with a good size living room and 2 bedrooms. The bathroom, kitchen and washing machine are on a mezzanine floor.

The jewel of this house is the second floor with a huge living room-bedroom that occupies the entire ground floor. In turn there is access to terrace and patio.

This area of the house can be reformed and add two more floors with wonderful terraces with impressive views. Project that the residents of the street have done, strengthens the house by 100%.


A property with endless possibilities. Do not miss the opportunity to visit it and create a great project.
