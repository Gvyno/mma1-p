WONDERFUL ELEVATED GROUND FLOOR APARTAMENT, WITH TERRACE AND NICE VIEWS TO THE MOUNTAINS. Located in Casares Costa, ONLY 1 KM FROM THE BEACH. Specifically between the port of Estepona and the port of La Duquesa, both 5 min driving, places where you will find a great selection of restaurants, beach bars and leisure areas. This fantastic flat with a SOUTHWEST ORIENTATION, which provides plenty of natural light during long hours of the day, is distributed on one floor, with two bedrooms, two bathrooms, RENOVATED KITCHEN, and a cosy living room that leads to the nice terrace through large windows, where you will enjoy beautiful sunsets. Within a quiet and well maintained gated community, with swimming pool for adults, another one for children, and garden areas. Including parking space within the complex. It is really a great investment and has a high potential for holiday rentals as well as long term rentals. We recommend to visit it!
