This plot of land is located in an exclusive, gated villa urbanisation on the outskirts of Alhaurin el Grande town. This very popular complex is just a few minutes from local shops, restaurants and bars and sits in a very peaceful area. Malaga city, the airport and the coast are all just a 20 minute drive away.
A 300m2 home can be built on this plot which would have stunning countryside views. Also available is the plot next to this one.
