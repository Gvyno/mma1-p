Excellent investment opportunity in the center of Torremolinos!

Fantastic penthouse with an enormous wrap-around terrace in the heart of town. All the amenities such as supermarkets, restaurants, pharmacies at your doorstep. The train to Malaga airport is less than 5 minutes walking.

As we enter the property, we have an entrance hall that gives access to a spacious bedroom, a separate kitchen and goes onto the spacious living room.
From the living-room we have a hallway that provides access to the bathroom and the second bedroom.

Every room in the property has a window to the terrace.

From the living-room, we access the best feature of the house, its terrace. The terrace wraps around the property and we would dare to say that there are very few properties in the center of town that has this size. On the terrace there is a shower for the hotter days. We have beautiful mountain and urban views, and on the other end we can see the sea. This terrace gets sunshine all day long.

This apartment was originally two separate properties, and can be divided again onto two one-bedroom apartments, multiplying the return on tourist rentals.

Viewings are strongly recommended.
