Lovely family townhouse with beautiful sea views in a quiet cul de sac in mid-Calahonda.
The house is built over 3 levels : the living-dining room and kitchen with sea views are on the entry level and the 3 spacious bedrooms are downstairs with access to the large patio, and a possible fourth bedroom is upstairs on the solarium level.
There is a first cozy terrace on the entrance side of the house and a drive way for one car. The entrance leads you to the fully fitted kitchen with a laundry corner,  a guest toilet and a bright living-dining room with fireplace and wooden beams on the ceiling and access to a nice south facing terrace partly covered with awning and beautiful views of the Mediterranean sea. From this terrace you can reach the solarium where the actual storage room could be easily converted in a fourth bedroom for guests with its own terrace and open sea views. Downstairs are the 3 bedrooms, all spacious and with wardrobes. The main one has its private bathroom with bathtub and the second one to be shared has a big corner shower. 2 of the 3 bedrooms have a direct access to the patio that offers a nice outside space for kids to play or just to chill out. From there, you can reach the communal swimming-pool of the Urbanization, only a few steps away.
This is a small and quiet community of only 16 houses. From there you can walk to a few restaurants in 5mn and be on the beach in a 10mn drive.

This is a perfect family house for holidays and to live all year around with a good size's rooms and a nice outside space.You can find everything you need in Calahonda without having to go into town. Marbella or Fuengirola are reachable in 10mn  by car, and you'll need 25mn to get to the Málaga airport.
