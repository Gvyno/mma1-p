BEAUTIFUL TOWNHOUSE IN GREAT LOCATION IN TORREMOLINOS

Magnificent townhouse in La Carihuela, a few meters from the beach and surrounded by all services.
A very spacious house built on three levels. On the ground floor there is a large terrace porche, once we access the entrance hall we find a large living room with fireplace, a toilet, a fully furnished independent kitchen with access to the interior patio.
On the first floor the three bedrooms and a large bathroom with a hydromassage bathtub and a shower tray.
On the top floor the solarium with a bedroom.
Sold fully furnished.

Very bright and quiet house near the promenade and less than 15 minutes walk from the train stop and the center of Torremolinos.
Ideally situated as it is only a short stroll to the beach and from there, minutes' walk in one direction will take you to the vast array of bars and restaurants situated on the traditional and exquisite mile long "La Carihuela" whilst in the other direction only minutes' walk away is the fabulously renowned port of Benalmadena, Puerto Marina. However, if you want bars and restaurants even closer, both are in abundance in extremely close proximity.
