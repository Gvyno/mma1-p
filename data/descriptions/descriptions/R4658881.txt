Amazing apartment with OPEN SEA VIEWS.
The house is distributed in an entrance, to its right an American kitchen open to the living room, then we find a large living-dining room with sea views. From the living-dining room we access a beautiful terrace where you can enjoy the views and a good barbecue.
Separating with a door we find the corridor where we find the two double bedrooms, one of them en suite with a newly renovated bathroom and bathtub and a balcony, and we also have a second full bathroom with shower.
