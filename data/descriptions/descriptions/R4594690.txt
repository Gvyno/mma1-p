It's rare to find a brand new, key ready penthouse in a central location in Estepona City at this price with this much outside space - a 48m2 roof terrace.

This property is a holiday rental workhorse and always booked making it a great investment. The development offers a large pool, gym, kids playground and easy access to Estepona's Old Town by foot.

It's 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, and 111m2 built with 131m2 of usable space given the large roof terrace. This penthouse is also an example of one of the few units in the development with an open plan kitchen/living room. Moreover, although it´s a 2 bedroom, it can sleep 7 comfortably making it a great holiday home, even for a larger family, as well as generating consistent year round rental income.

Underground Parking and Storage Room Included.
