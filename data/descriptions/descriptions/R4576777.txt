Top floor studio-apartment in a very central location in the port of Estepona. The apartment is on the 7th floor which is also the last floor of the building. The open sea view to the southeast is breath taking. The apartment has been completely renovated. All windows have double glazing, a new air conditioning system has been installed and all plumbing and electrics have been replaced. There is an elevator and the façade of the building will soon be repainted.
