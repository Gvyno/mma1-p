A very private country property, which is a dream for anyone with horses or wanting to live in a location of complete privacy, yet only 3.5km to the nearest village.

This pretty house sits on over 15.000m² of flat land with incredible views to the surrounding countryside. 

It is a single storey house comprising 2 very large bedrooms, open plan living / dining room with kitchen, and a bathroom.

Outside is a lovely, covered terrace from where you can enjoy the stunning views. The pool is completely private with no neighbours close by and there is also a 74m² storeroom.
