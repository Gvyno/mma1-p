AMAZING BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE OVER A FULLY FUNCTIONAL HOTEL IN RONDA!
This is definitely "A LIFESTYLE CHOICE"!
This charming Hotel in the hills of Ronda offers 18 rooms & 18 bathrooms. It is in an immaculate condition and offers from a standard room, to Junior suite, apartment to Duplex superior room. Each accommodation is totally different and has it's own charm. 
Secluded in the mountains you have beautiful green and panoramic views, a very peaceful setting with a river that flows by. A real retreat for the soul where you can enjoy the heated pool, the gardens and different seating areas. 
The Hotel has a fantastic restaurant which attracts local people and also tourists from the near by areas.
The hotel area covers over 1400m2 built on a plot of 6000m2.  
There is a function room for 65 people, which gets used for seminars. The venue is perfect also for weddings or Yoga retreats. 
The guests visit mostly for total relaxation, to hike in the mountains, to enjoy the nature, birdwatching or to visit other near by villages. Over the years there are many repeating guests who come back every year.

The current owners who have paid a lot of attention to detail, will now sell after 35 years and want to give their business into the hands of a younger couple. The hotel must be taking over with the 15 to 22 staff (seasonal) (waiters, chef, kitchen assistance, front desk, house keeping/ cleaners, gardeners, maintenance) who all live locally.

The owner's house borders on the far end to the hotel plot and can be purchased for an extra price. In addition, a 4 hectare Olive grove next door can also be purchased.
