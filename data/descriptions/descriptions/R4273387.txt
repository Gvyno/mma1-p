Great opportunity! Beautiful almost brand new apartment in the Las Flores area in Las Lagunas. It is very well located and surrounded by shops, schools, health center, bars and restaurants and sports center. It also has very easy access to the highway. It is located in a very well maintained block. The apartment has been used very little and everything is like new. Upon entering there is a large kitchen, unfurnished, and a very nice interior patio. Next to the kitchen is one of the two bathrooms with a shower. The living room is very spacious and bright. There is another bathroom with a bathtub and two bedrooms with fitted wardrobes. There is also the possibility of buying a parking space if required. It is a great first home opportunity or as an investment opportunity. Do not hesitate to contact us for more information and to organize a visit.
