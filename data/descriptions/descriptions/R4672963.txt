This beautiful apartment (finished in 2022) is located in a residential complex with beautiful common areas, outdoor swimming pool, beautiful gardens with pads, sports facilities and a social club, BBQ area in a beautiful enclave on the Costa del Sol. It has 3 bedrooms, a fully fitted and equipped kitchen, 2 fully equipped bathrooms, a terrace with breathtaking seaviews and outdoor parking included in the price.

This apartment in a typical "Pueblo Style Complex" is located in an elevated area in Estepona West (Manilva Costa) allowing breathtaking sea views and panoramic mountain views. This apartment is very comfortable, ample, and bright and finished with top quality materials and technology, including fully furnished and equipped kitchens, an intelligent home system, fitted bathrooms and installed aircon hot and cold.

Since this apartment is the ONLY 3 bedroom located on the FIRST LINE, this is obviously the most wanted prime location in the entire complex.  It is less than 1.5 km from the beach so perfect on foot or by (electric?) bike.   On the beach there are several (yummy!) chiringuitos incl beach chair rentals etc.  Through a newly built walking and cycling path you are barely 2.5 km away from the (very nice and pittoresque) port of LaDuquesa incl numerous restaurants, bars and shops. 

The urbanization is just 10 minutes from the historic center of Estepona, 20 minutes from Puerto Banús (Marbella) and Gibraltar airport and less than 1 hour from Malaga airport.
