FIND YOUR SANCTUARY: ELEGANT HOME NESTLED IN THE HEART OF EL PADRON!!
This exclusive hilltop luxury villa is the ideal property for those looking for a unique and tranquil location, whilst still being close to local amenities. With its spectacular 360-degree views, you can experience the changing colours of the mountains from the comfort of your own home. The villa is situated in a quiet, elevated position surrounded by nature and wildlife, yet it is only a few minutes away from the new Laguna village and less than 7 minutes from the centre of Estepona, and less than 5 minutes to the beach.

The villa boasts beautifully manicured and completely private gardens, with breathtaking views from every corner of the plot. There are ample terraces from each and every room to enjoy and take in all your surroundings and be independent of other rooms in the villa when you fancy that nice cup of coffee on your own, or a refreshing gin and tonic with freshly picked lemons and oranges from the several types of fruit trees on the plot.

The villa's interior is equally as stunning as the exterior, with every room having plenty of windows to allow for natural light and views from within the house. The villa is equipped with underfloor heating throughout 80% of the whole house, a full security system with cameras all over, and a demotic intelligent home operating system throughout the house where all electronics around the house can be controlled remotely.

This is a fantastic opportunity to move into a beautifully designed and expertly crafted villa. If you are looking for the perfect home to live in, please don't hesitate to contact us to arrange a viewing.
