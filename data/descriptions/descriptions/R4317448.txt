A magnificent and unique residential plot in Sitio de Calahonda.  Measuring 3,816m2 in total and with a building coefficient of 0.35%, it has already been legally segregated into six individual plots of between 595m2 and 643m2.  The land has unbeatable sea views all the way to Africa and is orientated to the South and West. This is a desirable location within a short walking distance to bars and restaurants including the popular Miel y Nata restaurant.  Just 5 minutes' drive to the nearest beach.

This presents a unique opportunity for a small developer to complete a project with a very high return on investment.  The present owner has already prepared a project for 6 contemporary villas with 4 or 5 bedrooms, approximately 395m2 of build including terraces and a host of spectacular features.  The plot can be purchased with or without the existing project. Project designs are included in the selling price.
