Villa with impressive sea view, located in a beautiful sought-after residential area (Urb. Santa Rosa), only a 10-minute walk from the idyllic town of Mijas Pueblo.

This charming one-level villa offers 3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, and a bright living room. Sliding doors create a seamless connection to the large garden (plot 1.332m2) with multiple terraces, ideal for enjoying the lovely weather and the fantastic views of the Mediterranean and Fuengirola. The villa has just been renovated with upgrades such as new windows, doors, bathrooms, electrical wiring, plumbing, air conditioning, floors, tiles, paint, and more.

NOTE that the buyer must install the kitchen, appliances, and outdoor lights themselves.

A private swimming pool with ample space for sun loungers completes the outdoor experience. An automatic gate at the driveway leads to a brick garage.

This is truly a property that must be seen.
