This is a great project for someone who wants to be right in the middle of a bustling town.  This property is currently on one level with lounge diner, separate kitchen, 2 bedrooms, shower room and an internal open patio.  There are new windows and front door on the entrance side of the house but the rest of the house internally needs completely reforming but  it will make a lovely home with everything you would need right on your doorstep.  However, from the more adventurous investor there is the potential to build 2 more storeys plus a roof terrace.
