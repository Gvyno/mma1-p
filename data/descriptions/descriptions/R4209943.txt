Fantastic townhouse in a complex located on the seafront, Bahía de Estepona.
It is the last one, so it is on the corner, thanks to which it has more light and more meters of private garden.
It has a total of 260 Sq m built, distributed over 3 floors plus a basement, which are interconnected by a private elevator. In addition to this, 50 Sq m of terrace and 180 Sq m of garden. Very quiet and residential community.
The main floor consists of a large living room - dining room, with a fireplace and direct access to the main terrace, which in turn leads to the garden, which borders the entire house.
Large room for the kitchen, which is not installed, with access to a small patio. 1 guest toilet.
On the first floor there are 2 bedrooms, both exterior and with fitted wardrobes. 2 full bathrooms.
Going up another floor, there is the master bedroom with a large private terrace from which to enjoy wonderful views of the sea, which is just a few steps away, and 1 more full bathroom.
The basement is made up of a large space to use as an additional bedroom or games room, 1 bathroom and the garage, with capacity for at least 2 cars.
It is worth noting the marble floors, centralized hot/cold air conditioning, exterior wooden pergola, PVC windows, fireplace and the elevator. It is delivered unfurnished.
