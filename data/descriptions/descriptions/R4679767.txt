Nestled just 100 meters from San Pedro Beach, this exquisite and fully reformed townhouse stands out as the prime example of luxury living. Having undergone a comprehensive renovation, the property was redesigned with a modern interior, high quality finishings/amenities and hand crafted carpentry throughout.
Every inch of this townhouse has been thoughtfully reimagined to allow you to experience comfort and luxury.

In addition to the 4 bedrooms, the house has the opportunity to be made into 6, with a washroom/study on the second floor and a large self contained basement (including kitchen/bathroom) which could be used as separate living or turned into a gym or games room. Currently designed as a movie theatre and gym.

A gated community with 24 hour security and an underground car park with double garage leads its way to a safe and very secure environment and one that is just 100m away from San Pedro Beach.

Two shared pools and plenty of outdoor space makes this property perfect for families. Just a stones throw away are the likes of The I/O Gym, NAC Padel Club, San Pedro Beach, Boulevard, numerous shops and restaurants, as well as International School Laude and San Jose Private Spanish School.

This property will not be on the market for long with unrestricted sea views from almost every room.
