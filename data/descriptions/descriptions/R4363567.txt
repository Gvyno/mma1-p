CORNER APARTMENT WITH PANORAMIC OPEN VIEWS IN MIJAS GOLF

The second floor apartment is owned by the original owners and has not been let out. When they bought the apartment they persuaded the developer to add certain items according to their own taste. Such as the special marble in the living room, a larger terrace, an extra long bath in the en-suite master bedroom, a hidden cupboard on the terrace with washer and dryer and the bedroom windows are floor to ceiling. It is in perfect condition.

You enter the entrance hall that leads you either to the living room or to the bedrooms. Continuing first to the living area we find a lovely bright spacious living room with American kitchen leading to the large southwest facing terrace. You will spend most your time here gazing a far or looking at the golf course. Even at nighttime it has a special feeling with all the festive lights from the nearby newly opened 5* Hotel Golf & Spa La Zambra (previous the jet set hotel Los Byblos).

We have 2 large bedrooms with 2 bathrooms. The property is situated on the top floor and is on a corner. We have windows everywhere and therefore it is very bright, light and private. The underground parking and storage are both included in the sales price. 

The urbanization has a lovely community pool and is very secure. Mijas Golf urbanisation has two 18 hole golf courses, Lagos and Olivos designed by Robert Trent Jones Snr.  The town of Fuengirola with its lovely beaches and long promenade is just 5 minutes away by car and the local bus has a bus stop nearby the apartment as well. Malaga Airport is less than 30 minutes away and Marbella 20 minutes.

Given its location, a quiet and relaxing environment, surrounded by spectacular scenery it is ideal to enjoy golf, mountain and sea. But you don't have to be a golfer to enjoy these special surroundings, nearby you also have the picnic areas along the river, many typical "ventas" and even an international school.
