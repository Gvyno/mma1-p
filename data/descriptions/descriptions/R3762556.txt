WONDERFUL TOWNHOUSE divided into three floors, which give a unique comfort and style to the home, distributed in a comfortable way to make the most of its large space.
It consists of a spacious living room with fireplace and terrace that communicates on one side to a patio and on the other side to the private garden with views of the pool. 

A good sized entrance area with the patio changed to an office under and a guest toilet. The first floor offers three bedrooms - all of them with own terrace and two bathrooms, one of them on suite. On the rooftop terrace you have lots of space and fantastic views. A separate guest toilet at the entrance and  in front of the house the Carport.

All this in a quiet gated complex with an amazing swimming pool, gym and sauna, surrounded by generous tropical gardens. Close to restaurants, supermarkets and all kind of amenities.

Less than 10 minutes drive to San Pedro, Marbella and Estepona and less then one hour to the Malaga Airport.

A wonderful place to be in a warm and welcoming urbanisation - WE HIGHLY RECOMMEND A VIEWING!!!
