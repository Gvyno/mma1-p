Great corner plot in a private urbanization

Building plot located on the corner of Ficus Street, at number 27, in the municipality
from Mijas. A few minutes from the highway, but located in a place at a height, in a private urbanization with 24 hour security, with access control and automatic fences.

Very well located, on the corner, the plot consists of 670 m2 and is sold with the possibility of a separate project. It has little unevenness and is located between two streets with several villas built, each one with its own plot, which gives it privacy.

If you want more information or to visit it, do not hesitate to contact me.
