Beachfront complex, Estepona, New Golden Mile. Fully renovated corner semidetached townhouse located in a front line beach complex that resembles a fishing village, full of character and tradition! The location is fantastic, 60 meters from the promenade & the Mediterranean sea and only 5 minutes away from Estepona center and 10 minutes away from Puerto Banus. Set in a peaceful environment where you can hear the waves of the sea. There is a fabulous beach restaurant 50 meters away. The property was completely renovated in 2003, Spanish/Scandinavian Style. The terraces have been very well insulated and new double glazed windows in Brazilian hardwood have been installed. Central gas for gas fire. The house comprises a total of 3 bedrooms, 3 bathrooms (1 bedroom and 1 bathroom on the ground level!), a large fully fitted kitchen, a nice living room and a beautiful patio for entertaining. Four storage rooms. On the first floor you will find 2 double bedrooms with en-suite bathrooms, and a superb roof top terrace with loads of privacy and panoramic views to the sea. Viewing are highly recommended.
Fabulous sea views from the upstairs terraces. A newly built promenade and a bus stop only a walk away so a car is not always necessary.
