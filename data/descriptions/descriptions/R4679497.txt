This is a very attractive penthouse with one million Euro views located in a small exclusive complex on the hill just above Elviria in the area known as La Mairena. The property has high ceilings and other attractive features that really set it apart from most of the apartments for sale along the coast.  The property has been refurbished by the owner that really understands how to bring out the best in any property by adding windows & removing unnecessary walls that bring in extra light. The new open plan kitchen allows one to survey the whole living area with its attractive fireplace.
