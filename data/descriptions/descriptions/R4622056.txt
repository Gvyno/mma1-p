Well-established restaurant for takeover, #1 on Tripadvisor. TRASPASO!
On one of the most charming squares in the lively village of Alhaurin el Grande, we find this successful restaurant. Due to an expansion of activities at another location, the owners have decided to sell the business, including the name, reviews, social media, and inventory.
The property is rented. It consists of three floors and a rooftop terrace. The current operators only use the ground floor (bar and kitchen) and the first floor. The first floor houses the restaurant area with 30 seats. There is space for 40 guests on the terrace. The restaurant and bar are tastefully decorated, making it a popular destination among Spanish, but especially foreign guests.
The success of this restaurant is evident in the reviews on platforms such as Tripadvisor, where they rank #1 in Alhaurin el Grande with a score of 5.0 (based on 344 reviews!). In 2023, they were also honored with the Travelers' Choice Award.
This is a unique opportunity to take over a thriving restaurant, with possibilities for expansion on the first floor and the rooftop terrace. It is also possible to use these floors as a private residence with some adjustments.

The owners explicitly request not to contact them directly but to route inquiries through the selling real estate agent.
