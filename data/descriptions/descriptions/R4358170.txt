Rare opportunity to acquire a magnificent 600m2 house in the Serranía de Ronda with spectacular views of the Mediterranean Sea, Gibraltar and the African coast, offering enormous potential for a Hotel and/or Restaurant business.
The house is located in the centre of historic Gaucín which, with its "Charming Mediterranean white Village" (Pueblo Blanco) feel, has become the place of inspiration and relax for many European artists and bohemians. From the town's ancient fortress, called Eagle Castle and built by the Arabs over the ruins of an old Roman fort, you can enjoy watching the flight of birds of prey, including the eagles that name it.
This huge house, built in 1970 over three floors with a 24m façade, features many elements of traditional design as a center of agricultural activity within the urban area, with large reception rooms and bedrooms, garage, stable, cattle shed, courtyard, barn and chicken run, which allow to re-create an Andalusian traditional house with all its charms. The 100m2 top floor with its independent access offers the possibility of living above the business itself.
This property has enormous potential to build a successful hotel business, including a restaurant on the ground floor, or a large stately home in one of the most attractive and picturesque towns in the Serranía de Ronda, with its unbeatable cultural and recreational offer.
