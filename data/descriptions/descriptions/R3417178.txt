Cártama is situated at the heart of the Guadalhorce valley, at the front of two small sierras and surrounded by thousands of citrus trees. It is one of the most extensive towns in the province and being close (17 km.) to the city of Málaga, the airport and the coast, it is a popular location! 

The village is divided into different communities: Cártama Pueblo, the old town, and Estación de Cártama, which is home to the railway station. The A-357 crosses in the middle. Both places have a vibrant centre, with lots of shops, bars and restaurants! Estación de Cártama not only links the village to the lively city centre of Málaga within 15 minutes, it is also a more and more upcoming leisure area. 


Cártama is only 15 minutes (16 km) from the city of Málaga and the airport. The beaches of the Costa del Sol (Torremolinos) are a 20 minute (20 km) drive away.
