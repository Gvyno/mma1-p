Beautiful villa in Costabella, possibly the area with the best beach in Marbella. The villa is on the beach side just 5 minutes walk from the sea. It is very well preserved and has many possibilities. It is currently made up of two independent Bungalows on one floor. Each with its own terrace, solarium and kitchen. One of them has two bedrooms and the other has one bedroom. However, being united could make a single house. The garden almost completely surrounds the house. It also has a large laundry room and workshop area as well as two closed garage spaces with separate entrances.
