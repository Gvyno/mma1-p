This is an excellent opportunity to acquire a property in one of the Costa del Sols favourites marina complexes.
The apartment is located just a minutes walk to the restaurants, boats in the marina and beach. The property is on the ground level allowing it to have a larger private terrace suitable for a BBQ and outdoor lunch while taking advantage of the Marbella climate. The property has been cleverly updated to include the extra bedroom and we strongly recommend a visit.
