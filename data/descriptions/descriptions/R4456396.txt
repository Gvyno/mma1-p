The perfect answer to Marbella living....a luxurious residence in La Quinta, Benahavís, offering the perfect balance of authentic Andalusian architecture with high-end contemporary comfort.
This immaculate la Quinta luxury villa is a delight to visit. Sitting on an elevated plot within the best location of El Herrojo Alto, this Marbella home has been reformed and updated to the very highest standards. The architecture, a synthesis of tradition and modernity, boasts two floors atop a substantial basement. Each level has its own charm; from the expansive ground floor's inviting ambiance to the breathtaking views savored from the top floor.
The heart of the home, a 44m² pool, glistens under the sun, while bespoke carpentry by OMEO Design accentuates the villa's interiors, with parquette ash oak adding warmth to the bedrooms and basement. The state-of-the-art kitchen, a masterpiece by Clive Christian, is fully-equipped with GAGGENAU 200 Series appliances.
Safety, convenience, and opulence converge here. From the integrated alarm system, the eco-efficient solar panels from JA SOLAR, to the GIRA domotic system boasting KNX connectivity – everything embodies quality and sophistication. The immersive experience extends to an audio journey, with Sonance audio systems harmoniously connected to SONOS and the villa's GIRA domotic system. For those moments of al fresco relaxation, James' high-end sound emanates throughout the garden and the second living room.
Not to be outdone, the exterior beckons with the promise of relaxation. A Mediterranean-inspired landscaping, thoughtfully crafted by BEATRICE PERLAC, surrounds the villa. Here, an exterior kitchen and bar area by TALENTI offers the best opportunity for al fresco dining, while the seating area with its gas fireplace promises serene nights under the stars.

Moreover, in this sanctuary, indulgence takes many forms. Whether it's the hammam with a double shower, the gym & spa area, the wine bar that houses a bespoke bodega by CAVANOVA, or the elegant fabrics from brands such as DEDAR & RALPH LAUREN that drape the interiors.

This Maarbella detached villa isn't just a residence; it's a statement, a testament to refined living in La Quinta. Dive into this world of unparalleled luxury and make it your own sanctuary.
