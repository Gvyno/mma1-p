A very attractive apartment with really amazing views over part of Miraflores Golf course, to the sea and along then along the coast.  The property is in very good condition and the current owners have upgraded the apartment with two new bathrooms and also a high quality kitchen with a granite work top. What really like about this property is its attractive and practical layout with a much larger than average living room that leads out onto the larger of two terraces. The complex itself is just two minutes walk from the Miraflores Golf Course with its restaurant and great atmosphere. The apartment comes with a private underground storage room and also a parking space. We strongly recommend a viewing of this property.
