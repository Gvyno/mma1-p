Unique, architect-designed contemporary villa that redefines elegance and comfort. Nestled in the prestigious urbanization of Sierra Gorda on the outskirts of Coín, this west-facing property is a true gem that enjoys impressive views from all living areas.

As you enter through the electric gate, the pristine driveway leads you to a meticulously designed ascending garden, setting the tone for the grandeur that awaits. The ground level unveils a spacious garage for 2+ vehicles, a fully equipped utility room and fitted kitchen, and a versatile 'multipurpose' room that adapts seamlessly as a gym, office, bedroom, or games room. This space could easily be developed into a guest apartment.

Venturing to the first floor, an inviting entrance hall welcomes you, leading to a generously sized guest bedroom with a private terrace and a bathroom featuring a walk-in shower. The heart of the home unfolds into an open plan living / dining area adorned with an African 'zebra' wood feature and a pellet burner. The luxury Schmidt fitted kitchen in matt white and light oak, complete with a large, shelved island, adds a touch of sophistication. Electric blinds, recessed coloured mood lighting, and a large Panasonic air-conditioning unit enhance the ambiance. The expansive terracing, including a covered pergola, seamlessly transitions to a large pool terrace with an 8x4 pool and a shower. A charming side garden pathway ascends to a gated planted area at the rear of the property.

The second floor introduces a spacious main bedroom with a dressing area and an en-suite bathroom featuring a curved glass feature wall and a circular bath with a shower head fitting. Two additional bedrooms, both capable of accommodating king-size beds, share a well-appointed bathroom with a walk-in shower. Each bedroom has access to private terraces and balconies.

The top floor reveals a large roof terrace, perfect for basking in the Spanish sun and enjoying the spectacular views. The property boasts air-conditioning units in three bedrooms and the living room, solar panels for the hot water system, and a water deposit tank.

The urbanisation itself is a haven of convenience, with easy access to the coast and airport. It features lush gardens with walkways, captivating fountains, two large supermarkets, a paddle tennis club, and a nearby restaurant. A mere 2-minute drive takes you to La Trocha shopping centre, home to a large Carrefour supermarket, shops, cinema, gym, and spa. This residence not only promises a luxurious lifestyle but also offers a perfect blend of tranquillity and accessibility. Don't miss the chance to make this exquisite villa your home sweet home.
