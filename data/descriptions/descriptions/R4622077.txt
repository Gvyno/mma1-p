This impressive luxury villa is located in the prestigious area of Guadalmina Baja, less than 100 meters from the beach. The property is situated in a quiet and private area but with easy access to the highway (just 2 minutes away), making it convenient to travel to Marbella and Estepona.

The villa, positioned on a corner plot, offers more square meters of living space and garden than neighboring properties. The property features a private pool and two floors.

The ground floor includes a spacious entrance hall leading to a guest toilet, a room with an en-suite bathroom, a modern and spectacular fully-equipped kitchen with state-of-the-art appliances, and a huge living room with access to the outdoor pool and garden area. Outside, there is space for sun loungers and two areas for a large table to enjoy the warm climate of the Costa del Sol with family and friends. The property also has parking accessed from the street.

On the upper floor, there are 4 bedrooms, all with en-suite bathrooms and access to terraces. Two of them have access to a south-facing terrace with sea views and space for sunbathing. The other two bedrooms have access to a north-facing rear terrace, where you can enjoy the afternoon sun. All bedrooms are spacious.

This property is perfect as a luxury rental investment, as it can accommodate a large number of people and boasts a unique location. However, this is just one of the many possibilities that this villa offers.
