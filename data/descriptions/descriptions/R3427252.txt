Area:
San Pedro de Alcántara is a thriving town located just 10 minutes West of Marbella yet has retained its small town charm despite a considerable rise in popularity and facilities.
10 minutes from Marbella, 5 from Puerto Banús, 10 minutes from Estepona and 45 minutes from Malaga or Gibraltar airport, it occupies a fantastic location in the middle everything yet quiet and relaxed.
The central point of the town is the recently finished Boulevard de San Pedro. A long and wide walkway, with footbridges, cycle paths, an amphitheater, fountains, plenty of play areas, 3 good bar/restaurants and with regular events and street markets, the boulevard has rapidly become the place to go for San Pedro residents and tourists.
From the boulevard a pedestrianized street stretches north to the church square with its pretty local church. The street is lined with dozens of cafes for watching the world go by as well as popular Spanish tapas bars. With plenty of shops, banks, supermarkets as well as gyms and health and beauty facilities, everything in San Pedro is within a 5 or 10 minute walk down its winding streets.
South from the boulevard, along a wide tree lined avenue is the beach, with a wide and long promenade with an equally spacious beach. With plenty of beachside bars and restaurants - "chiringuitos" – it's a popular place on a summer day and at the weekends in the warm and sunny winter days.
San Pedro also has the distinction of hosting the last summer fair (feria) in Andalucia, celebrating its patron Saint during the second week in October.
Within a short drive is the small white village of Benahavís and the beauty of the Sierra de Las Nieves and Serrania de Ronda natural parks, with plenty of hiking and mountain biking trails as well as pretty white villages and fantastic scenery.
