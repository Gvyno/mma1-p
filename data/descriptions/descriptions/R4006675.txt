This impressive property in Alhaurin de la Torre has been a beloved family home for many years. The large urban plot of 2400m2 is totally flat and would make a perfect spot for a garden or fruit tree orchard. There is also a large private pool with plenty of space for loungers.

The majority of the property itself is spread over one level minus the master suite and possible separate accommodation. On the main floor are three double bedrooms, a family bathroom, a large country kitchen and breakfast area and open plan living and dining room. There is also a utility room on this level. 

Upstairs is the master suite complete with ensuite bathroom, walk-in wardrobe and prive terrace. There is also a second, more communal terrace on this level that looks over the lush plot. 

Under the property is a space currently used as an office but that could be converted into a studio or extra guest accommodation.
