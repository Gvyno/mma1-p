The top floor hosts a separate guest suite with a bathroom, closet, fireplace, and an enormous terrace area with stunning views of the Concha mountain.

The basement is a true delight for the whole family, featuring a gym, sauna, steam room, jacuzzi, cinema room, full disco/bar, and a genuine Andalusian bodega with an additional kitchen. This floor also includes two bedrooms with bathrooms intended more as staff quarters and a garage for two cars. Two driveways offer parking for an additional 10 cars.
