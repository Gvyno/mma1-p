This elegant villa is located in a quiet community with nice neighborhood and good connections to all services. Within walking distance you will find various supermarkets, restaurants, a tennis club, banks, pharmacies and much more. Even the sandy beach with its popular chiringuitos can be reached on foot in about 30 minutes.

 This 600 m2 family home is divided into 3 levels. On the ground floor there is a very spacious living and dining room, a large kitchen with breakfast table and a practically situated laundry room. There is also a bedroom with en-suite bathroom & private terrace and separate guest toilet.
 The living room has cozy fireplace and access to a terrace with barbecue and beautiful views of the pool and garden.
 Heading up to the second floor we find a huge, bright master bedroom with its own OFFICE WITH FIREPLACE; the bathroom has a huge hexagonal bathtub and walk-in shower. And of course the master bedroom has its own terrace overlooking the garden.
There are also 2 children's/guest's bedrooms with sharing bathroom.
 The semi-basement floor is also impressive in size. There is a garage for 2 cars, a large GYM with a relaxation room (which could easily be used as a small CINEMA), another very bright and sunny bedroom (with windows facing to the South) and a bathroom with electrical SAUNA.
 The villa is equipped with an air conditioning system and GAS FLOOR HEATING in all rooms, which is very economical and convenient.

 The spacious garden of 1800 m2, surrounded by beautiful trees, has a large swimming pool, a summer gazebo with a second barbecue and parking space for even more cars.

 The uniqueness of the villa is that it is very private. Surrounded by neighbors, this house remains invisible to any of them.

Is's a gem in the Paradise!
