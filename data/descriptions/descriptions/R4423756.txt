Discover this beautiful 3-bedroom, 3-bathroom ground-floor  duplex apartment, perfectly situated in the sought-after area of Riviera Del Sol. With stunning south-west facing sea views, this property has plenty of natural light offering a panoramic view onto the sea and lower Riviera.

This elegant apartment has a modern Scandinavian style in white tones, creating an inviting and serene atmosphere. 
It is laid out on two levels giving it the feel of a townhouse.

On the upper level we have a hallway with 3 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms plus a nice terrace with sea-views.
The master bedroom opens directly onto the terrace, allowing you to wake up to the beautiful sea views.

Quirky stairs bring you to the lower level where you can find the spacious living areas with a patio door that leads out to the lower covered terrace with nice sea-views.  
The garden is communal but as it is the last unit in the corner you basically have private use of a piece of the garden while the community maintains it.
An open layout seamlessly connects the living, dining, and kitchen areas. The kitchen also gives access to a separate very large storage room.

One of this property's standout features is its panoramic top of the village-view, but yet still walking distance to the beach, restaurants and amenities

It's not just a tranquil home but also a promising investment opportunity, perfect for vacation rentals due to its  location and stunning views. 
The first occupancy and rental licences are in place!
