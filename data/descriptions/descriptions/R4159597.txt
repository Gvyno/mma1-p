Ground Floor Duplex in Marbella - Puerto Banus
This amazing water front ground floor duplex property is situated within a highly well-appointed
complex with 24 hours security service, close to the 5 star hotel Guadalpin Banus, and walking
distance to Puerto Banus along the recently built beachfront promenade. The community enjoys a
social club with cafeteria, tidy communal green areas, pristine gardens and swimming pool. The
luxurious finishes are noticeable from the entrance hall and communal areas decorated with
colourful stones, marbles and noble metals.
The finest materials, wonderful sunlight and seamless indoor-outdoor connection combine to
extraordinary effect in this significant residence, which provides flexible accommodation with its
two kitchens and independent entrances.
Originally two separate properties were joined together via a marble staircase in the lounge. The
accommodation on the ground floor comprises an entrance foyer with guest cloakroom and
kitchen with adjacent laundry to the right. The lounge with fireplace and dining table is facing
south west and has direct access both to the western terrace with jacuzzi and bar area (sink and ice
maker) and southern private garden with direct access to the communal area. There are two
bedrooms with two bathrooms. Both feature built-in cupboards.
The upper floor offers three more bedrooms, one fully fitted kitchen with adjoined laundry, a guest
toilet, two double bedrooms and one master bedroom with a fireplace and terraces to the west and
to the south with wonderful sea views.
Some of the additional highlights of this exceptional property are: 4 parking spaces and 2 storages
