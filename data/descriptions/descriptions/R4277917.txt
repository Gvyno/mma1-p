Beautiful apartment on the 4th floor of the Edificio Piscis  located in the center of Arroyo de la Miel, near the beach and the Renfe station.

The apartment with 46m² of built area has 1 bedroom, 1 bathroom, living room, hall and a glazed terrace with sea views

The apartment has access to a large communal pool with swimming pool and also has parking in the large on-site car park.


The apartment will be delivered with the furniture as shown in the photos, so you can move in immediately or rent the apartment or a combination of both. The apartment is very attractively priced and has great potential as an investment.
Living room with open kitchen, bathroom and living room with balcony overlooking the sea. Last year was made a complete renovation.
