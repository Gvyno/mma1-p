Living in beautiful Pueblo López is a dream for many. Entered from the historic Avenida Alcalde Clemente Diaz, this charming Andalusian-style two-story home opens up. From its private, lavish patio, you reach the picturesque alleyways and limestone houses of Pueblo López.

The house's entrance consists of a cozy hall with a beautifully decorated guest toilet and shower. Behind the clothes hangers there is a small storage room for suitcases etc. We open the double doors and enter the airy family room with integrated new kitchen and bar counter facing the dining room table. The window in front of the sink shows Spanish life and opposite the kitchen, windows and glass doors look out onto the sun-drenched patio. To the right of the room is the social area with a large sofa, table, TV and an electric fireplace in the corner.

The second floor consists of two bedrooms, both with several built-in wardrobes. Master bedroom has a French balcony overlooking the rooftops of Pueblo López. Adjacent to this spacious bedroom is a large fully tiled bathroom, also with wardrobes behind wall mirrors. The round shower and a window add charm and comfort. The second bedroom has two beds, wardrobes and bookshelves and a small TV. Outside is another bright bathroom with bathtub, toilet and washing machine.

Within a few minutes walk, you can reach both the supermercado, bustling square and varied shopping. In addition, you have the extensive beach, the wide promenade and the harbor with a fine selection of restaurants within easy reach. The train that takes you to all the pearls along the coast, the airport and Malaga is three minutes away. This is a house that the whole family will enjoy. Despite the street house's superb location, it is a peaceful and harmonious place to live.
