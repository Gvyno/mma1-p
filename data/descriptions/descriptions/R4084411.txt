We have several plots for sale in Marbella Club Golf Resort, a private, gated complex with 24-hour security and concierge, golf course and equestrian center.

It is a residential area in which it is important to maintain the natural environment where most of the plots have a minimum surface area of 4,000 m2, on which only approximately 10.6% can be built, with a maximum height of 8 meters or a ground floor plus 1, meaning this that the natural environment and privacy will always be maintained. Since most plots are sloping, basements can have higher views.

All the plots have beautiful views combining the forest of the area, with the golf course, views of the sea and the African coast and some even the horse jumping competition track. The complex also has a very nice Club House with the best possible service.

This plot is in an elevated position with mainly south orientation. It has great views and easy access. The land would allow for a basement with fantastic views. It would be perfect for building a "floating" house. Specifically, the plot has 6400 m2 and a building area of 678 m2.
