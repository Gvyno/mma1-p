A mansion-like villa was originally built  as a large family home in a very nice urbanization close to Torremolinos, the airport, and Malaga center. Also close by there´s the commercial center Plaza Mayor and the Parador de Golf. The villa offers 11 bedrooms and 7 bathrooms all built around a patio which gives all rooms plenty of light. The floors are mainly high-quality marble and the finishings are the top of the line for when it was built. The property is in need of some updating but this would be easy since both the quality of the construction and the plumbing is in great shape. Heating: The villa has underfloor heating by conduction of water, centralized by means of a natural gas boiler and a 500-liter accumulator in a closed circuit.
