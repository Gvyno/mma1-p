Located in one of the most emblematic and exclusive areas of Málaga we find this beautiful two bedrooms apartment and 2 bathrooms.it is just 5 minutes walking to the famous beach of La Malagueta and only 15 minutes walking to the historical center of Málaga.

Imagine living so close to the historical center but in a more quiet area surrounded by all the amenities and facilities and being able to go by foot to the beach or refreshing yourself in the community pool.

The  apartment comes with one parking space and a storage room.
