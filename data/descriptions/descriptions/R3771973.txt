961m² urban plot in Tolox. The plot currently has a house built on it, but it requires a total structural reform to be able to live in it.

The plot is fully fenced with some fruit trees and offers wonderful views of the town and the mountains. It has town water, is ready to hook up the electricity supply and it is close to all the amenities that the town offers.
