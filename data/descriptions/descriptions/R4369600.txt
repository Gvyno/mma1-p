162 - In one of the most requested areas and with  fantastic  views, we present this independent villa with a lot of character. EL LAGAR, where the villa is located, is at the entrance of the town with very good connections to the coast, Malaga and its airport -about 15 minutes-
We will not discuss that it needs a freshig up,  but just that, a review and, of course, put it to one&#039;s taste! but we cannot doubt that the potential exists and the house haunts you as soon as you enter.  We are welcomed by a mature and charming garden that leads us to the main house; And I say main because in the lower area there is another quite complete apartment with a totally independent entrance.
It is clear that the house has been built with great care and love, we are greeted by a hall in which is the guest toilet, on the right hand side is the imposing living room - dining room with its fireplace and large windows that open onto the chill-out style terrace; about views, I don&#039;t think I can find an adjective to describe them! IT IS A LIVING LANDSCAPE!
On the same floor is the large, very complete and recently renovated kitchen with quite an important space to eat and have a good time while cooking.
We access the upper part, by confortable stairs,  where the three bedrooms are, spacious and complete with their wardrobes as well as a spacious bathroom.
From the terrace we go down to the garden and pool area, a spectacle of surroundings! From the pool we have a terrace that overlooks the small apartment that we mentioned before, with its independent entrance from the outside through the vehicle entrance area; a garage for -at least- two vehicles and with a lot of possibility of expanding.
