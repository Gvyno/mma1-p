Given the rise of Sotogrande from being a well known gated community for the Spanish Elite, to now a well known community for the International Elite, prices have risen. Sotogrande International School continues to attract many buyers for its reputation with the International Bachelorate Program. With these factors in play, it is rare to find a large detached villa in a good location for less than €1m, not least at the price point.

This property in the B Zone is very well connected - easy for the school run, to walk to Paniagua (currently being expanded/refurbished), as well as Pueblo Nuevo. The B Zone is known for being a great family are and is ""beachside"" ie the Costa side of Sotogrande. With 5 bedrooms and 4 bathrooms, as well as a large private plot, beautiful pool area, direct access to a green zone, and a guest apartment, there is a lot on offer.

The property is quirky in that is split across multiple levels, however this adds to its charm. Those with imagination can see that with investment in bathrooms, painting, and kitchen, you have a wonderfully unique property on a street that has seen many buy, refurbish, and make beautiful modernised homes.

This does not need to be done all at once, as the property is structurally sound and very livable indeed. 

Simply put it is a great deal in a low inventory market, and viewings are highly recommended!
