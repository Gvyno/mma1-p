This property is very, very unique! Set in the heart of Arroyo de la Miel, it has been a family home for many years and is in need of renovation. There could be a possibility of building an apartment block, as many others have done in the area. It has sea views and close proximity to all the amenities which Arroyo de la Miel has to offer and also close to Paloma Park and the coastline of Benalmadena. The train station is a short 5 minutes away. At present the lower level has 3 bedroom and 1 bathroom and you walk into the lounge. The kitchen and an exterior patio area is located to the left on entry and has separate access to the road, as this is a corner plot. The upper level has a room and a huge terrace with a roof. Possibility of constructing something to include parking. This would all have to be approved by the townhall.
