This is an attractive loft style apartment in the attractive Port of Cabopino. On the paper work this property is still a local not an apartment and change of usage needs to be done with the town hall if you want to use it for holidays or live in it etc legally - Ask for more info. This property has lots of natural light and afternoon sun from large west facing windows. It has been modified internally many years ago with a mezzanen type extra level. We feel the property would benefit an investor looking to completely refurbish the property, although it is currently in use as an apartment and with some decluttering and a painting it would look much better. On the paper work the property is still officially a local, but other Cabopino owners have successfully changed the usage from local to apartment in the same complex.  The property has two bedrooms and two bathrooms. Looks good as an investment project with an interesting price for a frontline port complex. The complex has two nice swimming pools and communal garden plus a communal parking area for owners.
