The plot continues behind the house with the cultivation which has its own legalised well, as well as water from the irrigation community (30 minutes to fill the pool). The harvest in a peak year is about 3200kg of fruit.

The house, very cosy, is distributed in an entrance hall which houses the dining room open to the living room and the kitchen as well as a small additional living room/room with solid wood sliding doors.
