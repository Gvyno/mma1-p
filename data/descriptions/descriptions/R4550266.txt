Embark on the enchantment of Villa Oasis, an exquisite five-bedroom single-family residence nestled in Fuengirola. This meticulously designed property spans an expansive one thousand one hundred and twenty-five square meters, offering an idyllic retreat north of the Malaga-Fuengirola railway line.
Strategically positioned, the villa is surrounded by scenic landscapes, creating a haven of tranquility.
This two-story gem underwent renovations in 2008-2009, showcasing a perfect blend of modernity and timeless elegance. The ground floor features a welcoming hall, a bedroom with an enclosed shower room and WC, and a guest toilet. Another double bedroom with a fitted wardrobe has been ingeniously transformed, with the wardrobe replaced by a fully fitted kitchen that can be closed with sliding doors. This bedroom also provides access to the garden and pool area. The ground floor is completed by a cozy living room with a fireplace, an additional living area, a convenient storage room, a guest toilet, and a well-appointed kitchen. The lounge living room seamlessly opens onto the large and well-equipped kitchen. Notably, a sliding door separates the living room and the kitchen, offering the flexibility of creating two distinct rooms as needed. Additionally, the ground floor features a charming patio, a delightful porch, and designated parking.
Ascend to the upper floor through an elegant hall to discover a shared bathroom and three bedrooms, one of which enjoys the luxury of an en-suite bathroom. Explore further to find a remarkable fifth bedroom built into the mezzanine. Accessed from the first floor through a beautiful spiral staircase, this fifth bedroom boasts an ensuite bathroom, a double bed, and access to a private terrace with breathtaking sea views.

Villa Oasis features outdoor amenities that elevate the living experience. A big private pool beckons, accompanied by a partially covered terrace and a jacuzzi situated next to the pool. All set within a large, green, and flat area, this outdoor haven invites you to enjoy barbecue time, bask on sunbeds, and relish the stunning sea views from the ground level to the topmost floor.
