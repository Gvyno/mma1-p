Rare opportunity to purchase a residential plot (1232 m2) in the desired urbanization Marbesa. The plot has a granted building license in place, so everything ready to start constructing. Of course changes can be made to the current design. The majority of all fees (topographic survey, building license, architect) have been paid, so these are included in the asking price.

Some specs of the current design:
* Built 650 m2
* Terrace 117 m2
* Beds 6
* Baths 6.5
