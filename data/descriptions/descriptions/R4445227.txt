NEW TO THE MARKET

Detached 3 bedroom, 3 Bathroom sea view villa with private pool.

We are pleased to bring to the market this wonderful, detached 3 bedroom 3 bathroom villa for sale in El Faro, Mijas Costa.

The villa is located in a very quiet Cul-de-Sac street, less than a 5 minute walk from the beach.

As you enter the villa at street level, you are welcomed by a nice reading porch/conservatory which has glass curtains that can be fully opened, if desired.

The property is very bright and airy and boasts a very nice open plan, fully equipped American kitchen. 
There are 2 double sized bedrooms with fitted wardrobes on this level; one of the bedrooms has its own, spacious en-suite bathroom with a shower cabinet and in addition there is also a guest bathroom with both a bath and a walk-in shower. 

The living room is large and bright with loads of light flooding in through the large patio windows and terrace doors that lead onto the lovely terrace.
On the lower terrace, you find your own private pool and there is also the separate access to a large fully fitted studio apartment. As you enter, there is an open plan, fully equipped kitchen, bathroom with a huge walk-in shower and a large lounge area, which overlooks the fabulous swimming pool.

On the upper level of the villa there is a solarium area, which has a great panoramic views of the pool, surrounding forest and the Sea.

The beach is a short 5 minute walk from the villa, as are Restaurants, Bars, Supermarkets and Pharmacy.

El Faro is located 3 km from La Cala de Mias, and the same distance in the opposite direction is the famous town of Fuengirola.
