This property is stunning! Set in the heart of Mijas Costa, in the desirable Campo Mijas area. From the private entrance there is a driveway and garage, with steps down into the main entrance. This floor has a very spacious lounge area, with a great reception area and plenty of comfortable chairs, to take in the Hollywood style which the villa exudes. This then takes you down to the focal point of the villa, which is the pool and the beautiful gardens. Elevated higher is the dining area and a big kitchen. The bedrooms branch off to the other side of this main level. Up higher is an attractive bedroom which has been modernised,  with a stylish en suite bathroom and a great terrace,  to behold the spectacular views. From the outdoor terrace, which overlooks the pool, there is an independent apartment which again has a very nice lounge area,  and on the other side of this lower area is a huge indoor bar and games room. Great for those lazy summers!
