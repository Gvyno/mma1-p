Fantastic semi-detached property with three large floors in Los Boliches.
It is distributed on the lower floor with a bathroom, kitchen, and living room with access to the patio and terrace, on the second floor we have 4 large bedrooms, and a bathroom with bathtub, and on the third floor is the solarium.
Due to its orientation to the west, it is illuminated by sunlight during all times of the year.
Its strategic location offers proximity to all amenities: shops, schools, supermarkets, fairgrounds, and the center of Fuengirola, and a 10-minute walk from the beach.
Well connected with the access roads to Malaga and Marbella.
