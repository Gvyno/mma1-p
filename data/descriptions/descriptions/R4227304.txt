*** Spacious Villa in King & Queens, close to El Polo - Sotogrande *** 4 Bedrooms & 4 Bathrooms *** Independent Guest House *** Covered Parking for 2 Vehicles *** Wide Garden with Swimming Pool, Century Trees & Mediterranean Vegetation *** Unbeatable Location in a very Exclusive Private Urbanisation ***

This villa is situated in King & Queens, Sotogrande, a private and exclusive urbanization, located next to the Polo Course, just a few minutes drive from the Sotogrande Golf Course and the Sotomarket Shopping Centre, where you can find all the services and boutique shops of the area.

The villa is the ideal investment and renovation project. It is accessed from a quiet and private road lined with mature trees. The main house is on one level, with three bedrooms, each with its own bathroom. The kitchen and living room open onto a conservatory style dining room. The house has a charming original fireplace in the living room.

The gardens are landscaped with overgrown tropical plants which gives the house all the privacy you would expect. Also, here we find an extensive swimming pool.

Next to the pool there is an independent guest house, consisting of a living room with its own fireplace, a bedroom, bathroom and a space that could be equipped for a small kitchen. The independence of this house is perfect for family visitors or for the service. In addition to a carport, there is also a secure double garage.

The property would benefit from renovation and extension. There is great potential to extend and add floors to this exclusive villa in Sotogrande.
