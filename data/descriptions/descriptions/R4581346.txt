Welcome to Aldea Dorada and this beautiful semi-detached house with an amazing setting in the hills above La Cerquilla.
This spacious house is divided over two floors and as you enter you are welcomed by a large hallway, with high ceilings and great natural light. On your right you have the living and dining area, connected to a fully equipped and large kitchen. The ceiling height in the living rooms is striking and makes the room impressive, here you have a fire place and lounge area that accesses out to the terrace. The terrace offers amazing views over the coast, with the mountains and sea. On this terrace you have a private plunge pool, sunloungers and a barbecue and dining area that is covered with a pergola. Perfect to use all year round! 

On the entrance level you also have a large bedroom, with dressing area and en suite bathrooms. This bedroom leads out to the terrace and offers great views. In the hallway is a separate guest toilet. 

As you walk down you find to separate suites on each side of the stairs, one that could be the second master bedroom with amazing space and ceiling heights and a modern bathroom that was built a few years ago. This bedroom has direct access to the second terrace, a nice lounge area with nice views as well. 
On the other side you have the third en suite bedroom, also with access to the terrace. 

The house would be perfect for permanent living or as a holiday home for the ones who needs a lot of space. Easy to maintain and in very good condition. However, the house has enormous potential to be modernised and updated to an even better house.
