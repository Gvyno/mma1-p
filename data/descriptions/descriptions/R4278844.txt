Beautiful single storey villa in the peaceful residential area of Torreblanca in Fuengirola.

The property has 2 bedrooms, one of them with en suite bathroom, the second one is a large guest bathroom, a spacious living room from which we can access to a covered terrace, a fully renovated kitchen with breakfast area and with direct access to the back terrace, a very cosy dining room on two levels from which we can enter to the outside terrace and the pool area.
The property also has a storage room and a small garden at the back of the house as well as a closed garage.
The villa has been renovated with wooden floors, new kitchen and bathroom, a new fireplace.
The pool (low maintenance) is heated.
Renovated in a markedly Nordic style and with good views to the sea and the whole area of Torreblanca, we have sun practically at any time of the day.  
The property is located in a quiet area but very well communicated only 5 minutes drive to the beach.
