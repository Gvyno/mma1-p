La Madrugada is rumoured to be the most beautiful house on the Costa del Sol

If you are interested in pure nature, low building density, panoramic sea and mountain views,  100% privacy and at the same time you want to be close enough to the best infrastructure the Costa del Sol has to offer, La Madrugada is the perfect match. Another unique selling point of this estate is its extraordinary volume. Every room of villa 1 offers double ceiling height, which in terms of build makes it in reality double. It  could be as well  a nice boutique hotel, sporting retreat or clinic. As such a  unique  estate cannot be captured  by pictures and words a personal viewing is highly recommended.

Built in the Moorish/Spanish style with authentic fountains and age old tiles, one enters through imposing glass and wrought iron doors to a magnificent courtyard flanked by fifty-one carved stone arches and stately palm trees.

To the side is a vaulted "Al Fresco" dining area capable of seating more than twenty. The french doors lead to the drawing room and through to extensive stone terraces which overlook the beautiful mature gardens, gazebo, pool and private lake with the sea in the distance. The house lends itself to fabulous and capacious entertaining.

The 2  properties  sit in a private estate of 330 000 m2 which is home to abundant wildlife. Situated four kilometres from the sea between Puerto Banus and Estepona, it is only minutes from elegant 5*hotels restaurants and shopping facilities. 

The unique geographical location affords it complete privacy with superb sea and mountain view.
