AN OUTSTANDING OPPORTUNITY to own an IMPRESSIVE FINCA OF 30,000M2 OF FLAT LAND with 1,000 walnut trees and a beautiful, stylish modern home with a private swimming pool and exceptional views.

The approach to the property is very special, through large gates and up a tree lined avenue with walnut groves on each side. There is a wide parking area at the front of the finca and a newly constructed warehouse of over 45m2.

The property is beautifully constructed with clean lines and a modern, sleek design.

The entrance hall leads to the large open plan living space. This area is very welcoming, full of natural light, with high ceilings and a feature Bullerjan wood stove that heats the entire house.

This large and practical living space incorporates the sitting area, dining area and a modern kitchen fully fitted kitchen creating a wonderful living space.

From the living space doors lead to three double bedrooms. Two bedrooms share a large modern bathroom and the master bedroom has an en suite bathroom and dressing area/walk in wardrobes.

The top floor of the property has been left for the future owner to complete as they wish. There is ample space for a number of en suite bedrooms, a library/study and a further reception room.

The first floor has two large balconies with the most spectacular views over the surrounding countryside.

Thanks to a brand new road, finished in 2020, Ronda town can be reached by car in only 8 minutes!

The finca benefits from its own water and a new heating system was installed in 2020.

This really is an exceptional property and viewing is highly recommended.
