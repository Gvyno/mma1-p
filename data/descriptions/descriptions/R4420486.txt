Located in the popular beachside development of Hacienda del Sol this is one of the better duplex apartments in the urbanisation.

The kitchen has a utility area and is fully fitted to a high standard. Again, unlike others it has a very spacious kitchen. Just outside the kitchen is a guest cloakroom. There is a hallway which leads to all of the bedrooms. The master bedroom is en-suite while the other two share a bathroom.

There is an internal stairway which leads to the roof terrace (solarium) which is huge and has a built in BBQ, spectacular 360 degree views and a Jacuzzi (built in by the current owner).

On site you can find multiple swimming pools, a gym, Jacuzzi and padel court.
