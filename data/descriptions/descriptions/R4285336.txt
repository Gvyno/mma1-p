House with guest apartment in the nature reserve of El Chorro

This house is situated in a beautiful location in the nature reserve high on a mountain.

The moment I drive up this mountain in El Chorro I already know that this house is situated in one of the most beautiful locations .
The road to it and the fantastic views make you feel immediately one with nature.The house itself is in very good condition and it is a nice bright house.
There are several entrances but I decide to enter through the kitchen.
The kitchen is very complete and fully equipped and thus very pleasant to work/cook in.
Then we enter the central hall where the original front door is located.
Attached to this hall are all accesses to the 2 bedrooms (1 with ensuite bathroom), bathroom and beautiful bright living room.
This spacious living room has large windows with fantastic views over the valley.
This property has a tower room which is now used as an office and music room.

Opposite this house is the guest house with 2 bedrooms, bathroom, living room and kitchen.
To the side of this guest house is a spacious garage/workshop.

Between both houses is a nice patio and very spacious terrace and here is also a bathroom with shower and toilet.
On the main house there is also a roof terrace .

All facilities are connected.
