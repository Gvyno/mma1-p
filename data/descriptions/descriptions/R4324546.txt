***New exclusive listing*** Now, listen to this ladies and gentlemen, because this l gem is stuffed with more goodies than you find inside a Christmas turkey. 
First of all you will find three bedrooms and two bathrooms all separated from the social areas. In addition you will get to enjoy a large terrace, covered (with glass curtains) as well uncovered with direct access to one of the swimming pools. Mind you, this particular pool is, due to its limited size, rarely used by the residents, so it almost feels as if it is your own.
And you thought this was it? Not quite - please let me continue the presentation of this kinderegg. There are three more swimming pools in this urbanization and the icing on the cake - a padel court only a few triple jumps away from  this apartment. Garage and store room are also included in this purchase and believe it or not - the vendors will throw in the furniture as well.  Walking distance to the marina of La Duquesa, supermarkets, restaurants, bars and last but not least 'la playa'.
This package has it all and the gut feeling says it will not be on the market for long, so please waste no time. Contact us today for a viewing!
