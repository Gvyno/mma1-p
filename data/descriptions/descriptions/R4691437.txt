If you were looking for the whim of your life, here it is! This property is situated on the fourth floor of a custom built building for nine neighbours, in the heart of Fuengirola, 100 metres from the Plaza de la Constitucion.
This property originally, on plan, would have been two bedrooms, two bathrooms, lounge, kitchen and balcony, but it is not....

Now it is a home made to whim, with the best facilities and unobstructed views. Not forgetting that it has a storage room and a state of the art aerothermal system.

The property currently has a spacious living room with a wonderful open plan kitchen, designed and furnished to a high standard, a large bedroom with its own dressing room, a beautiful bathroom with shower and a balcony which can be accessed from the windows of the living room or the bedroom.

Possibility to convert it into a holiday rental.

The property is semi-furnished.
