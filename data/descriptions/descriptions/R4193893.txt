Impressive semi-detached villa in the exotic urbanization of La Virginia with an excellent location in the city of Marbella on the Golden Mile.

Corner house that offers two different accesses, front entrance through the beautiful Plaza de la Primavera and the second, direct to the living room and kitchen floor. It currently consists of two large bedrooms but can easily be converted back into 4 bedrooms as it was originally. Its bathrooms have been refurbished in a marble style and it offers sanitary pieces signed by Starck for Durabit. One of the few homes that has a private garage and a large room to use as a gym, games room or cinema.

Magisterial 19th century doors adorn the house. One of the best maintained in the urbanization, it stands out for its fine and simple lines that add elegance to its Andalusian-style façade. A unique piece, of distinguished beauty and with beautiful views of the sea and La Concha.

We find all kinds of restaurants and shops just 10 minutes away on foot, and in just 10 more minutes we will reach the Paseo Marítimo and the beach.

An oasis of beauty and relaxation in the heart of Marbella.
