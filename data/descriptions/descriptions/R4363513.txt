A fantastic 3 bedroom beach side penthouse in the centre of La Cala de Mijas with stunning sea views from the terrace and all bedrooms! La Siesta Beach II is a gated complex on the second line beach with underground parking, lifts and lovely gardens and pools just 50 metres from the beach. The lounge leads on to a large terrace which is part covered for shade and the rest open to enjoy the sunshine. The master bedroom has a refurbished en-suite shower room with the other two bedrooms sharing a large bathroom. This is a rare find on the beach side in La Cala.
