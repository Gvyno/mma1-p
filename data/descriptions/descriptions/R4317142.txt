Do you live or work in the downtown area of ​​Avenida de Mijas?

According to Ecologistas en Acción, we Spaniards spend an average of 75 hours a year looking for parking. If we do the calculations of what it means for the pocket to look for parking, for example, drivers in the main cities of Spain spend an average of 634 euros a year just to park occasionally in the center of the city, leaving the car in a parking or in the blue and green zones (ORA/SER). In Barcelona they spend 682.24 euros every 12 months to park the car on time, and in Madrid 585.52 euros, and Fuengirola is not far behind.
To this we should add the costs of renting a garage space... But if there is something that is spent going around to park and has more value than any material thing, it is our time and our patience.

Now you can stop stressing and dedicate that time to something else!
