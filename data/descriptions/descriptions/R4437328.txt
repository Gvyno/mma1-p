Lovely villa located in the ever popular El Pilar community of El Paraiso. Walking distance to restaurants, bars, gym, tennis & padel club, supermarkets etc.

The property has a large drive that can accommodate 3 cars and the garage is large enough for 2 cars. On entering the villa you have an enclose hallway with a beautiful wooden door that leads directly into the lounge / dining area with a cozy fireplace. The views from the dining area are stunning as the garden is very matured and extremely private. The kitchen is a good size and is fully fitted with doors to the terrace/garden and the kitchen windows over look the garden and 32m2 pool. The large covered terrace is a delight along with the fantastic gazebo at the back of the garden. This property is South West facing so the shaded areas make the outdoor living perfect for long summer evenings!

On the ground level there are 3 guest bedrooms - the larger bedroom has and en-suite and a terrace. The other 2 bedrooms share a large bathroom with walk-in shower. All bedrooms are of good size and have fitted wardrobes.

On the next level we have the master bedroom with a very large en-suite and a 50m2 wrap around terrace with amazing views of the gardens and mountains.
