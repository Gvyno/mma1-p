Really nice small Finca in Alhaurin de la Grande.  The Finca has been recently refurbished and as you can see the living area is all on one level.  Enter through the nice bright glass conservatory where you have sunshine nearly all day and from here you enter the house which has a sitting room with fireplace and american style kitchen.  The house also has 3 double bedrooms and 2 bathrooms.  The masterbedroom is ensuite and has a big walkin dressing  area.  T


The villa/finca  has it's own private swimming pool, and  it also has it's own well.

The Finca has 1,858m2 and is divided in two parts, the upper part with the house, pool and plenty of garden space and the lower part which has access via a path  is a flat plot of land so ideal for fruit tress or even to keep some horses etc.

The good thing about this Finca is the access, it is off road on a very good rural road and the turn off is  near the Garden Centre which is on the Fuengirola/La Cala de Mijas to Alhaurin road.   The road to the Finca is fairly flat so no scary drops on the way to it and less then a 5 mins drive.

This Finca is ideal to live in all year around or use as a holiday home.
