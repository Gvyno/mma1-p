Don&#039;t miss this fantastic apartment with breathtaking views of Marbella&#039;s harbor area, beaches and the Mediterranean Sea.
When you sit on the balcony, you will sit for hours enthralled by the adorable view.

Top renovated with two bedrooms ensuite and an extra toilet with washing machine. The apartment also has a tastefully built-in terrace that is used as a wardrobe.

The apartment also comes with a parking space. For those who know the building, the latest news is that it will have a new roomy elevator, instead of the two old ones, which until now were considered a minus for those clients who liked the apartment. The community fee will not be influenced much.

Don&#039;t miss this opportunity!
