This is a fabulous and spacious 3 bedroom townhouse located in a tranquil area and yet still only 5 minutes drive to either Fuengirola or La Cala de Mijas.  The property is set on 3 levels and you enter in the middle level where you find the spacious lounge with dining area, semi-open kitchen and double patio doors to access the terrace, from which you have beautiful countryside and sea views.  Upstairs, via the unique circular staircase is the master bedroom with en-suite shower room, built in wardrobes and a private terrace that enjoys the same views as the lounge terrace.  On the lower level and bedrooms 2 and 3, both also with en-suite shower rooms, built in wardrobes and terrace with similar views to the others.  All three en-suite shower rooms have been recently renovated and there is an additional WC on the lower level, together with a large utility room and storage room.  There is another terrace which leads you through the front door that enjoys evening sun.  Within the community gardens there is a lovely swimming pool which you can use all year round and as there are only 10 properties in the community this is an ideal property for a large family who enjoy peace and quiet and yet are still only a short distance to towns with various shops, cinema, restaurants and bars.
