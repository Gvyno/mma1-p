Spacious duplex Penthouse in the heart of San Pedro!

Beautiful penthouse with excellent location - walking distance to everything! Just 15 minutes from the beach, and all amenities you could wish for just outside the door!
This large duplex penthouse is located on the fifth floor with excellent natural light, sunny terraces and a great layout. Once you enter you have a welcoming entrance with wardrobes and storage space, leading towards the heart of the apartment. Kitchen and living room are unusually spacious with a dine-in kitchen, and a living room with dining as well. The kitchen is fully equipped and has great storage and room for cooking for the whole family. Connected to the kitchen is a utility room/ laundry.

On this entrance level you will also find one of the bedrooms with a family bath adjacent. And also a guest WC. The living room has access to a sunny and covered terrace with views over the city, some sea view and pool view.

Moving to the upstairs there are two large bedrooms, one of them en suite with a dressing room. Both bedrooms has access to the large solarium/terrace.

This penthouse is in great condition and ready to move in but could also be a great investment for modernization. You can create a fourth bedroom, open up between the living room and kitchen, or just put you own touch on it!
Perfect for those who wants to be in the center with everything within reach, or for permanent living in a great spanish town!
A must see!
