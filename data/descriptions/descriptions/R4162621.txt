UPDATE 15/03/24: Now this villa is fully furnished and ready to move in.

Spectacular contemporary one level villa with probably the best panoramic sea views on the market, and within walking distance in Marbella East.

This villa has been renovated and transformed into a contemporary bright villa, but without "breaking" the charm of the original Andalusian house, without converting it into a white box villa.

Situated in a very quiet area in Elviria, still within walking distance to all the amenities and to the beach, with fantastic views to the sea, Gibraltar and to the African coast, this villa has 4 spacious bedrooms ensuite and a guest toilet. A beautiful open concept fully equipped kitchen leads to the living room. Behind the kitchen there is a big utility room with external access.

The master bedroom, perfectly located in front of the house, opens up to the beautiful sea views and the terrace with infinity pool.

This villa is built on one level, so there are no steps, no stairs and everything is easy to access.

There is a 40 m2 extra installation and storage room in the basement.

All the installations such as photovoltaic and heat pumps for underfloor heating and aircon are completely new and make this villa an energy certificate A villa.
