This beautiful country property is located in a wonderful enclave in the heart of the Ojén mountain range, and from the moment you set foot on the property, you feel a special energy that emanates from the lush trees and majestic mountains that surround it. This home is truly a haven of peace, with a 3,131m² fully fenced, practically flat, and extremely private plot. From here, you can enjoy spectacular views of the surrounding mountains.

Every detail of this property has been carefully considered by its owners from the beginning. The house is built from 120-millimeter solid Estonian laminated timber, with ceilings and floors insulated with 5-centimeter natural cork, ensuring high-quality construction and a cosy living environment. The house is raised on pillars and has a lattice chain network that embraces the entire structure, providing solidity and durability.

The house extends over a single floor, with a loft that is used as an additional room. On the ground floor, there are two large bedrooms with built-in wooden wardrobes, two bathrooms (one of them en suite), a kitchen with a pantry and utility room, and a large, welcoming living room that opens to the beautiful exteriors that surround the house. In the living room, a Balkan Fireplace (Log Burner) not only provides heat during the cold season, but also distributes heat to all rooms using individual heaters. Double security glass windows with mosquito screens ensure a quiet and comfortable environment inside.

Outdoors, you will discover a fantastic pool that currently uses chlorine, but has the pre-installation to change it to saltwater, giving you options for its maintenance and comfort. The house has been built following organic and feng shui principles, paying special attention to orientation to make the most of sunlight and achieve maximum energy efficiency.

The owners have also taken great care in the design of the exteriors, choosing trees that provide shade in summer and allow the sun to enter the house in winter. In addition, the plot has a variety of fruit trees, such as apples, quinces, avocados, walnuts, blackberries, among others, which will provide you with fresh fruits during the different seasons.

This property is ideal for those looking for a house removed from the hustle and bustle of the city, but who want to be close to all amenities. La Cañada shopping centre is just a 10-minute drive away, and the charming town of Coín is a 15-minute drive away, while the airport is approximately 40 minutes away by car.

If you are looking for a property that combines luxury, comfort and respect for the environment, this is the perfect choice. A mountain refuge that will allow you to enjoy the peace and beauty of the Ojén mountain range in all its splendour without sacrificing the convenience of modern life.
