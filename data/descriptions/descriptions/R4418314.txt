Third floor west facing very private apartment in a fantastic location only 10 minute walk to Puerto Banus, amenities nearby.

This modern apartment is located in a large gated development with 24h security and just a 10 minute walk from Puerto Banus and the beach. 

The property has 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, a salon/dining area with access to a spacious terrace, and a fully equipped kitchen. 

Being on the third floor brings a part open terrace for extra afternoon sun, with an awning (toldo) fitted to the pergola ceiling as well as a second sun shade that opens to the front. The master bedroom has full height glass double doors that open onto a small Juliet terrace. This extra feature is very unusual in this development and transforms the master bedroom! 

There are marble floors and air conditioning throughout the apartment. Included in the sale price is 1 underground car parking space. 

The community has tropical gardens and two large swimming pools with clear mountain views. Lifeguards are on duty between May and October. 

The communal areas also include 6 paddle tennis courts, a playground for children, and a popular restaurant. The development is next to a 9-hole golf course. 

This bright west-facing apartment is in a wonderful convenient location close to Puerto Banus. The development has an excellent rental history.
