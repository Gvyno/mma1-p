Townhouse in quiet area, 4 bedrooms, with independent flat. Benalmadena Costa

This townhouse is ideally located in the quiet and safe residential area of Torremuelle in Benalmádena Costa. The street is cul-de-sac and only residents drive on it so it is easy to park in front of the house.

Entering through the porch there is a separate guest flat (1 bedroom, fully fitted kitchen and modern bathroom with shower). From there you go up to the main house via the outside staircase to the large covered terrace with unobstructed and pleasant views towards the sea and the green area in front. Next to the entrance hall there is a guest toilet and the spacious living room with wood burning cooker and dining area.
The kitchen is large, with white goods and dishwasher. It overlooks a lovely backyard, this patio has fruit trees and a nice area to enjoy al fresco meals. 

On the following mezzanine floors we find a modern bathroom and 3 spacious bedrooms, the master bedroom with access to the large terrace of 40 m2 with panoramic views towards the valley and the sea. 

The property belongs to the urbanisation of Torremuelle which has large communal areas: the Parque Misterioso (park area), large swimming pool and tennis and paddle courts. The train station is at 1,3 km and the sea at 2 km.
The house is south facing so it is very bright and consists of 172 m2, partially refurbished and in good condition (sold unfurnished).
