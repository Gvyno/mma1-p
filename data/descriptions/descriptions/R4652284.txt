Good apartment located near the Center of Malaga, port, beach and public transport .
 The apartment has a large living room with open kitchen.  The terrace of the living room opens onto a pedestrian street. Kitchen and bathroom renovation is recommended. 
Negotiation on asking price is possible.

A good investment for rental or sale after renovation.
