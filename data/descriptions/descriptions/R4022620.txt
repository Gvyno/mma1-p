Amazing price drop!! Will you be in time to enjoy your summer home? High quality building pays off as you can see at La Perla de la Bahia. Enjoy spacious rooms, large terraces and lush gardens with a sea view! This elevated ground floor apartment (so more privacy than a normal ground floor) uses a mixture of marble and terracotta tiles on floors, with Spanish hand-painted tiles in the kitchen and bathrooms.  The living room opens out to the very large terrace which leads on to a private garden offering views to the lush grounds of La Perla de La Bahia. It is a two bedroom apartment but the room next to the living room can be used as an extra bedroom or tv room. The kitchen could be opened up to be openplan. Furthermore it has under floor heating, hot/cold air conditioning and a fireplace! There is a very large underground parking place and storage included as well. La Perla is only 5 min. drive to all amenities and leisure areas including excellent golf courses, one of them Finca Cortesin, home of the Volvo Masters. Next to La Perla is the luxurious beach club of Finca Cortesin! Recently renewed: fridge/freezer SMEG and a washing machine.
