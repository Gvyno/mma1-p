Located a short distance away from the sea and the best beaches of East Marbella, in the middle of a charming white Andalusian style urbanisation, the property stands out for its amplitude, its beautiful well kept private garden of 95m2 and its fantastic panoramic views to the sea and the protected green areas of Los Monteros.

It is worth mentioning that the property consists of two townhouses joined together.
The entrance floor is distributed in an open plan kitchen and two spacious living areas, with access to two beautiful terraces, and a guest toilet.
The three bedrooms, each with its own en-suite bathroom, are located on the ground floor, which is connected to a large garden that offers, with no doubt, the best views of the Marbella coastline.
The basement counts with a multifunctional and very comfortable work space.

Due to its south-southwest orientation, the villa enjoys a great luminosity throughout the day.
The location is central and easy to access, within a well-developed residential area and close to all amenities: beaches, restaurants, schools, supermarkets and medical centres.
The best golf courses in the area are only 5 minutes away. Communal swimming pool and outdoor parking.
The property is sold unfurnished.
