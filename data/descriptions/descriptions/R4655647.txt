Opportunity - 2 bedroom penthouse in El Presidente, with roof solarium.

This pretty apartment is located on the top floor of its block and enjoys South Westerly views over the gardens and swimming pool.

Within easy walking distance to local bars, shops and restaurants, as well as being a short 5-minute stroll to the beach makes this apartment very desirable.

The apartment has a spacious lounge /dining room with a separate kitchen.

The master bedroom has fitted wardrobes and an en suite bathroom. There is a second double bedroom and a family bathroom.

The terrace overlooks the swimming pools and there is a roof solarium.

This is an ideal second home or investment purchase in a development where apartments are extremely hard to find at the moment.
