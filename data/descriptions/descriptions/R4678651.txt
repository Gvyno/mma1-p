With 182 m² of living space and an 72 m² terrace, you'll have plenty of room to enjoy the stunning views of the tropical garden and mountains. What more could you ask for?
This apartment is absolutely amazing! Plus, it's conveniently located near Puente Romano, Marbella, and the beach, so you can easily take advantage of all that the Costa del Sol has to offer. And the best part?
You'll be living in a gated community with concierge service, a large swimming pool, and a beautiful garden to relax in. This first floor apartment is absolutely amazing! It features a spacious living room with a cozy fireplace that will make you feel right at home. And get this - the living room could even be converted into an open kitchen, making it perfect for a family who loves to cook and spend time together. This apartment truly has it all.
While the kitchen could be converted into a fourth bedroom, I highly recommend keeping it as a kitchen for added functionality. But that's not all! There are three bedrooms and four bathrooms, all with fitted closets and ample storage space, so you'll never have to worry about clutter.
And don't forget about the parking space and storage room with elevator access - talk about convenience!
Constructed in 2002, this amazing apartment boasts modern amenities such as air conditioning and an elevator! Its east-facing orientation provides ample natural light in the morning and afternoon, making it the perfect place to start your day with a smile and enjoy the sunshine!
