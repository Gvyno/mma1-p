*TRASPASO* Fantastic opportunity to acquire this turnkey business situated in the heart of Los Boliches. The business is situated on busy little street with a large footfall as it leads to the beach and surrounded by many holiday apartments and other local businesses. The business has a large number of regulars and of course due to the location is an obvious destination for tourists. The owner has been meticulous in all aspects of compliance and there is nothing to do, other than to add your own branding and make it your own. The current opening times are 08.00 to 15.00 but this could easily be extended into the night to capitalise on the tourist trade. The owner can provide fully verified accounts and the monthly rent is 1350€/month.
