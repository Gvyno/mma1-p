A very large house which has so much potential to repurpose the current interior metres for additional living space.  Currently you have 3 very large bedrooms, plenty of terraces plus a huge open plan lounge kitchen diner on the ground floor which leads on to your own covered terrace with private garden and your own swimming pool.  There is also a second lounge diner and second kitchen on the upper floors which could easily be used as additional bedrooms if needed.  You also have the use of the communal swimming pool and paddle court which feel almost private due to the low density of the complex.  There is so much more to appreciate with this house so please contact us and arrange a viewing without delay
