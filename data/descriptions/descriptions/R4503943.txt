Large house in the centre of Cancelada with almost 4,000 m2 of land around it.

The house is separated into three apartments (with different deeds), a large basement, swimming pool and irrigated field, currently used for fruit trees.

It is particularly interesting as a project for investors who would like to make it into a small aparthotel or apartments for rent, or for someone interested in renovating it and converting it into a single large villa with its own plot in the center of the town. The plot itself is very interesting to build on and highly profitable due to its location.
