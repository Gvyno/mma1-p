Spacious middle floor apartment with two bedrooms (both with ensuite bathrooms) and a gorgeous west facing terrace with views across gardens and countryside to the Mediterranean. 

Despite its tranquil location, the apartment is within an easy stroll of shops, restaurants, supermarkets, tennis, golf, bowling and much more. It's very easy to access from the communal parking area with no steps to consider. 

Inside, the apartment has been very well maintained as a holiday residence by its owners. The rooms are large, clean and full of natural light. There is a fireplace for winter evenings as well as air conditioning. The L shaped kitchen is bright and in good condition with a laundry nook to hide away the washing machine and tumble drier. The double bedrooms both have built in wardrobes and plenty of space.

The covered terrace is beautiful, enjoying fantastic, calming views across the countryside. It also benefits from electric awnings which have been installed by the current owner.

This community is in the process of building a new swimming pool which they hope to complete by summer 2024
