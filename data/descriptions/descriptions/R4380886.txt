This residential plot is unique, in that it takes up 742m2 and has entrances on 2 separate streets. It is located in an urban part of Las Lagunas where most of the land has been used for 4 storey apartments. At present there is a villa and a factory located on the land. The factory was employed to make sweets. Huge potential. Can be turned into a huge investment. Scope to build apartments as in most neighbouring plots, or could be put to commercial use. It is south west facing, another attractive element to this land.
