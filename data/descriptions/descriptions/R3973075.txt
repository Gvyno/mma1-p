Property in Casares with two houses.
The house is located on Calle Camachas, less than 2 minutes walk from the municipal parking area and 20 steps from the town square.
The star location of this home makes it a very comfortable home to live in all year round or to convert it into a B&B.

The house consists of 2 apartments, which share a communal patio.
The first apartment is built on one floor, has all the windows facing the patio and has a small living room at the entrance that can be expanded, since in a previous work a bedroom was made. With a small reform you can make the living room more spacious.
It also has a nice bedroom and a large kitchen with a dining area. This apartment has a hall that can be used as an office and a bathroom with a shower.
The second apartment is newly built with very good qualities, spacious, very bright and is built on 2 floors.
On the ground floor there is a large living room with a fireplace, and from here through a small hall you access the large kitchen with a dining area.
The kitchen has access to a comfortable private terrace with mountain views and from this terrace, in the past it could be accessed through stairs that today cannot be used to the street.
On the same floor there is a large bedroom and a bathroom.
On the second floor is the spacious master bedroom with lots of natural light, a very spacious second bedroom with views of the Sierra Crestellina, a large dressing room and a complete bathroom with a hydromassage bathtub.
This floor has access to a small terrace that has the laundry area and access to the very large roof terrace of the house.
The roof is large, food and has wonderful views of the Sierra Crestellina and the white houses of the town.
