The long-established, very well known and popular music bar has been offering live music on weekends in summer time, open all year long, and it is known to be the only dancing floor you may step on in the area in winter time. The bar and restaurant offering Spanish and German food and all sort of drinks, it has always been run by a friendly family, clients and friends were very regular visiting it. There is a lot of parking space on the streets around, it is very easy to find, and it has a studio apartment being refurbished now on the top of the main building. It is available fully equipped, and ready to work, but a new outfit and an enthusiastic new ownership would make it become a fantastic and rewarding business. There is no competition at all to consider within a business plan here. Some night-life would be surely of great acceptance in between a strongly rising number of residents and holidaymakers too.
