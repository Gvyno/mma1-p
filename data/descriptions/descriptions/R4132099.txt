Benaojan:
This Andalusian village is one of the region's finest examples of Pueblos Blancos and nationally renowned for its sausage production. It has Moorish origins. The area is popular for rural tourism, and offers excellent walks, mountain views and potholing. Indeed, the lower part of the municipality runs into Grazalema Natural Park, with the valley dominated by the striking limestone peaks.
The most important fiesta is celebrating the arrival of the railway and the boom it sparked. The Verbena del Tren is an open-air event at the railway station at the end of July. At least 80 kilos of Benaojan sausage are laid out for partygoers and the sangria flows. Other fiestas are celebrated on the 25 April to San Marcos and on 7 October for the Virgin of Rosario. The famous Cueva del Gato (Cat Cave) is a few km from the village.
