Nestled just above Puerto Banus and along the winding road towards the picturesque Istán, lies a remarkable duplex apartment that embodies the essence of luxurious living. Let's take a journey through this property's key features, as they come together to create an unforgettable story of modern elegance.
The front door opens to reveal an open-concept living space that beckons with its elegance and sophistication. Natural light dances through the windows, casting a warm glow on the tastefully chosen furnishings.

Venturing further, we discover three spacious bedrooms, each with its unique charm. The master bedroom offers a tranquil retreat with a private ensuite bathroom, a haven of relaxation with panoramic views right from your bed. The two guest bedrooms are equally inviting, providing ample space and comfort.

As we step onto the wrap-around terrace, a breathtaking panorama stretches before us, capturing the azure waters of the Mediterranean Sea and the lush greenery of the surrounding landscape. It's a canvas of ever-changing colors, a masterpiece of nature to be enjoyed from sunrise to sunset.
Residents form a close-knit and exclusive circle of neighbors who share a passion for luxurious living. Immerse yourself in the communal swimming pool, stroll through the lush gardens, or park your vehicle securely—all within the confines of this fantastic community.

Just a stone's throw away, we find ourselves in the heart of Puerto Banus, a vibrant hub of entertainment, shopping, and dining. The world-renowned marina beckons, offering a glimpse into the glamorous lifestyle Marbella is famous for. And when the allure of the marina subsides, wander the charming streets of the Old Town Marbella, steeped in history and culture.

Panoramic views, elegant design, and the embrace of a vibrant community.
