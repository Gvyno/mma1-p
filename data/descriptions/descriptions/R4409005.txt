Step into Casa Joline, a completely renovated, single-floor villa offering the epitome of modern mediterranean-style living in the heart of Nueva Andalucia. This 4-bedroom, 3-bathroom gem has just been renovated in 2023 with high-quality materials like wood, ceramic, and marble, and comes furnished with custom-made, high-quality pieces. Appliances are from the trusted brand, Bosch.

As you enter, you're immediately welcomed into an open-plan kitchen and living area that extends out to a chic Capri-inspired garden through large sliding doors. This private oasis offers a diverse range of outdoor experiences—from dining and BBQ areas to chill-out zones—all set against a backdrop of lush palm trees and greenery. The first guest bedroom to your right, as well as the en-suite master at the end of the hallway, offer large sliding doors that open out to this exquisite garden. Two additional guest bedrooms can be found to the left, sharing a separate bathroom.

The garden features a modern swimming pool strategically positioned just steps away from the kitchen and living area. Casa Joline is really a hidden gem thanks to a private road leading to the entrance of the house, complete with parking inside of the gates.

The property is ideally located, surrounded by a myriad of shops and restaurants. A quick drive will take you to Puerto Banus and the beach, and for golf enthusiasts, several courses are within reach. The prime location makes this property ideal for renting out all year around. Adding icing to the cake, the villa allows for a second level to be built, offering future expansion possibilities.
