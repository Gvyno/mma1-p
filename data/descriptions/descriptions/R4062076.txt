Great opportunity to purchase a total of more than 22.000m2 of land in the area of Tolox, offering different fruit trees, avocado trees and olive trees. There are two plots next to eachother which are to be sold, one plot has a small farm house and has a land of 10.180m2. The second plot right next to the first one offers 12.099m2. Great access on a paved street to both plots, also having its own water well, a river floating along the plots as well as the small villa already being connected to electricity. Tolox is located between Alozaina and Coín, small villages located on the eastern slope of the Sierra de las Nieves and about 40km away from Marbella and 55km from Málaga city and the airport. Great potential for a weekend home, possibly a camping ground, to keep your horses or other animals or to run your own production of oil, fruits or vegetables.
