This is a two bedroom property, with a communal pool and views of the sea from the terrace.

It is a spacious apartment, which would be a fantastic rental property or a holiday home.

The two bedrooms are both a good size, as is the main living area.  The terrace is spacious enough for a table and chairs, and has an amazing view of the green area in front, then the sea.

Great investment opportunity
