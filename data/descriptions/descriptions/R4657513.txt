La Trinidad complex is located in the heart of Marbella's famous Golden Mile, next to the Royal Saudi Palace. Known as one of the most important and prestigious areas of Marbella, this complex has everything a discerning property owner could wish for.
La Trinidad's low density and natural surroundings allow residents to enjoy a unique lifestyle in terms of quality, comfort and security. Completed in 2003, the development consists of one hundred and sixteen modern two and three bedroom flats and penthouses built to an unusually high standard.
Set in seven acres of lush tropical gardens, with 24-hour security, the apartments are built to the highest standards with the highest quality joinery, superbly fitted kitchens with state-of-the-art appliances and bathrooms with the finest marble. Each apartment has beautiful sea or mountain views.
The complex has a gymnasium, two large outdoor swimming pools, a full size heated indoor pool and a cafeteria (open during summer holidays).

La Trinidad is within walking distance of the sandy beach and excellent beach bars, supermarkets, shops and many top quality restaurants. The bustling Puerto Banus and the charm of Marbella are a short drive away and the Nueva Andalucía golf valley is just a short drive away.
