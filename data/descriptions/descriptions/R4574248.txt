Well presented 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom first floor apartment in a very popular and well established community, a short stroll to the centre of La Cala and the beach.  This lovely southwest orientated apartment has a welcoming lounge with direct access to the covered and glass-curtained terrace, which in turn has excellent views overlooking the communal garden and swimming pools (one adult with easy access steps and one children´s pool).  Back inside the apartment the master bedroom also has direct access to the terrace, built in wardrobes and an en-suite bathroom.  The guest bedroom also has built in wardrobes and looks out to the street on the opposite side of the building, as does the fully fitted kitchen and guest shower room, which is located between the guest bedroom and kitchen.  As you have windows on both sides of the block it´s easy to create a cool temperature during the warm summer months and to supplement this natural cooling, you also have hot and cold air conditioning throughout the apartment that you can easily set to the optimum temperature for you.  Included in the sale price is a secure underground parking space, with remote control access from the street and direct lift access from the parking level to the apartment.  As La Cala continues to grow in popularity with many international clients choosing to buy a holiday home in this area, early viewing is recommended.
