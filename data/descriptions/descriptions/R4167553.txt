Great opportunity for a rustic home with 3 plots of land.

These plots are located in the tranquil countryside of Villafranco, with great access and close to the nearby towns of Coin and Villafranco.

The main plot is 7300sq m. with various fruit trees like pomegranate, apples, oranges, etc. and also 44 Pecan nut trees.  It has a 50sq m building, which could be extended, with one bedroom, lounge area and bathroom, which is currently being used as a weekend home and a private pool. Apart from the building there are 3 bedroom units, all with air-conditioning which the owner rents out for short holidays with a shared bathroom and kitchen facilities.

There is a well on the plot but there is also a communal well for drinkable water. Irrigation water is also supplied in the summer which is pressurized and runs through closed pipes.

There are 2 further plots in close proximity, one of 1700sq m and another one of 4500 sq m, with agricultural license and very fertile soil.

The building is in need of renovation but has the upside of making it your own, as well as owning extra land, all for a very competitive price.
