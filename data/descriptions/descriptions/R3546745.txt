Coín is the central town of the Guadalhorce valley. It is the place to be for locals and farmers living in the surrounding villages, as Coín offers a wide range of shops (Mercadona, Dia, Aldi, Lidl), garages, agricultural shops and fruterias (local fruit and vegetable stores). 

Not only agriculture is very present in Coín, the typical Andalusian lifestyle is also an important aspect of daily life in the village. The Romería and Fería of Coín are the biggest and most impressive of the area and also the New Years Eve celebration (Noche Vieja) is something Coín is famous for. 

Next to the many local tapas bars and restaurants, there are tons of outdoor activities you can enjoy! Hiking, cycling, horse riding.. On Sundays there is a big antique market and a local food market at the parking of the shopping mall ‘La Trocha'. The mall also offers a big cinema, where they play English movies on Tuesday, and a rooftop gym with a pool. What more do you need? Coín has it all, and although the village is very close to all locations, you feel inland in all aspects surrounded by the olive and orange groves and distant mountains. 

The village of Coín is only a 20 minute (35 km.) drive from Málaga and the airport. The beaches of the Costa del Sol are just a 30 minute (26 km.) drive away.
