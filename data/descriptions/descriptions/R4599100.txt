Penthouse located in phase 3 of the residential Arenal Golf looking over the Bil Bil golf course.
The living room and the master bedroom have golf and sea views.
This penthouse has 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms.
The living room is good size and has cream marble flooring (like the rest of the flat).
The kitchen is closed. The bright living room has direct access to the south-facing terrace, which is great to enjoy the endless Spanish summer.
The master bedroom has built-in wardrobes and a bathroom ensuite.
The guest bedroom is good size and so is the guest bathroom.

Included in the price are a storage room and 1 parking space in the underground parking garage.

The Carrefour Express is just on the other side of the street, so is the Nova School (private school) and Vithas Hospital. A few hundred meters down the road you will find the public school and public hospital.
Transport nearby, so are the Bil Bil restaurant, park and playground. This is a fantastic area to live all year round.
