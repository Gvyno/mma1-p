Immaculate ground floor traditional townhouse with sea views situated in the centre of Sabinillas, 50 metres from the beachfront promenade. Recently reformed to high standard with brand-new stone flooring, white washed walls and walk-in shower, the property is in excellent conditions, fully equipped, and ready to live in or rent as holiday home.

The house consists of two bedrooms, one double and one single, both equipped with built in shelving and storage space; the brightly lit corridor leading from the front door opens through an archway onto the salon and kitchen/ dining room. The kitchen is fully equipped with gas cooker, electric oven, and fridge freezer. There is a utility space adjacent to the kitchen with washing machine and extra storage. The recently refurbished bathroom has a walk in shower and plenty of natural daylight. 

The living space extends to a lovely secluded, tranquil, west facing patio, ideal as a sunbathing spot or additional sitting and dining area. The key feature of this property is the exceptional view of the Mediterranean from the main living space. Thanks to its prime location you will enjoy spectacular sunrises flooding the house with morning light, and unique views of the sea throughout the day.

Its sought after location, second line beach, makes this property an ideal investment for holiday rentals. It is centrally located and walking distance to shops, supermarkets, restaurants and cafes, transport, children playground, and all services.
