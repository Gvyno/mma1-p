A one of a kind 3 bedroom apartment located in the delightful Costalita Urbanization only seconds away from the refreshing Estepona sea.

The property can be accessed either through the gardens or through the underground parking.

As we enter the apartment we are welcomed by a huge open space which consists of kitchen and living room. The kitchen is fully equipped with the latest appliances and includes  generous space for cooking.

The living room has an ample and generous space for relaxing and has a lot of light which comes in from the panoramic window at the end of the room where the office is located along with the dining area.

From here we can observe the amazing tropical gardens comprised in this luxury complex and it also leads onto the master bedroom which is tucked away for better privacy from the rest of the property. The master bedroom has nicely sized fitted wardrobe along with ensuite bathroom with shower.

On the opposite end of the apartment we find the hallway access to the other two bedrooms and bathrooms. The second bedroom houses its own ensuite bathroom with the rest of the apartment.

The apartment includes two parking spaces and one storage room.

Costalita is an amazing suburban residential area with the best sandy beaches along the New Golden Mile, Estepona. From the urbanisation you have direct access to the sea. Thanks to the new construction of the promenade you can walk or cycle all the way to Estepona or the opposite way to MARBELLA and there are many chiriguitos  and restaurants on the beach along the way very close to the property.
