FREEHOLD - An incredible opportunity to purchase approx 950,000 ha of land / 2 semi detached houses with two floors / pool / self contained flat with large barn / old cortijo and barn and a cortijo ruin in an unrivalled location of the beautiful city of Ronda. 
This stunning location offers a fantastic opportunity to anyone looking for a large piece of land for development.
Located just outside Ronda in the heart of rural Andalucia but still within just 50 kilometres of the coast.
This dramatic piece of land, due to its size and geography, offers endless opportunities for investors. 
It is permitted to build 220,000m2 of the estate which is located in the municipality of Ronda. This development permit has come with the designation "Turístico y Social sobre Actuación Urbanística". Luxury villas, a hotel, bungalows, studios, a wellness complex with a sports centre and even a campsite are all part of the alternative possibilities for a tourist complex based on the municipal decision.
Architectural plans have already been drawn up for a country hotel and the land has been allocated a "caza mayor" for hunting. This would be a great opportunity, as Ronda is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Spain.
With its proximity to Ronda, this plot is very suitable for development, and plans are also available here, for new build villas of up to 220,000m².
The large barn and surrounding land on the northern part of the plot provides the perfect facility for cattle breeding and farming.
This is an excellent option for the discerning investor, so many opportunities in this prime location are rarely available at this price.
