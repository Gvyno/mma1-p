Your imagination is the only limitation with this property. 

This old olive mill, is here waiting for someone to fulfill  it's full potential to be anything the new owner wants it to be.

Set in 2,000,000m2 . Its 5 minutes from the Cartama and Pizzara road, access is great as its a new concrete road all the way to the property has not long been constructed.

A mixture of flat and hillside landscapes with amazing views. The land is plenty full with Fruit trees and fresh water in abundance and irrigation systems in place. Scattered over the property are some 12 Cortijos , some are in need of repair, some just need some TLC including the main mill house which is 4 bedrooms, and the Huge Top Cortijo  is built structurally with walls and roof but internally its a blank canvas to design as you like with wood vaulted ceilings.

Next to the Mill house is Stables for 17 horses, a large paddock, corals and out buildings. 

Its ideal for a luxury retreat, for farming , a luxurious Equestrian center as so many trails and a vast amount of land to hack out on.
