The orientation is, fundamentally, north, south and east and in any of these winds you can enjoy extraordinary views that go from the southern slope of the town to the sea.
Given the orientation of the land, exposure to the sun is total over the entire area.

 In total, there is 15,591M2 of land on which a maximum of 195 homes can be built. 
Of these 15.591M2  are available to build  10,913M2 on which a total of  136 homes and/or a "Pueblo Mediterráneo" can be build (depending on what the developer prefers). 
The remaining 4,677 M2  are designated for building "VPO" homes (up to 59 units maximum).
 Please note  that we have a list of buyers (!) who are eager to  purchase the VPO homes.
