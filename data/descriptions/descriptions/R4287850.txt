"A Dream Born Among Blues: The Promise of a New Dawn"

From my recent awakening in 'Lomas de Mijas', every day feels like the first ray of sunlight caressing the sea. I am the fruit of new construction, where every detail has been thoughtfully designed to offer you not just a home, but a sanctuary of dreams and serenity. With 605 m² of land and 226.37 m² of living space, I stand as a modern sanctuary, designed to inspire you from dawn to dusk with breathtaking views and an ambiance that invites full living.

Let me tell you about my charms: I offer four bedrooms and four bathrooms, each a private and peaceful space where rest becomes an art form. My kitchen, the true heart of the home, is fully equipped with SIEMENS appliances, promising to awaken your culinary senses with every use. But my most precious jewel is undoubtedly my infinity pool, from where you can immerse yourself in a mirror of water that reflects the endless blue of the sky and the sea.

Born in a charming and tranquil residential area, my location offers the best of two worlds: the peace of a serene environment and the rich culture of Mijas, an Andalusian village that jealously guards its heritage. Here, where luxury meets tradition, I offer a unique lifestyle, in perfect harmony with nature and the heritage that surrounds us.

I am more than new construction; I am a promise of happiness, a blank canvas ready to be filled with your most cherished moments. I invite you to discover me, to dream about what could be, and to take the first step towards a life where every day is a work of art. Contact and come to know me, I am one of the houses that speaks for itself, and let yourself be carried away by the promise of a new dawn. Ready to start this journey together?
