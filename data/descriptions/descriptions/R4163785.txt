Fantastic local in the heart of Marbella.

Premises of 120 m2 now working as a Restaurant.

It is located in a busy street and surrounded by all kinds of stores.

It has a license granted by the town hall for a terrace of about 40 m2 where you can put about 8 tables. Inside there is space for about 8 more tables. 

Great opportunity on an incredible location!
