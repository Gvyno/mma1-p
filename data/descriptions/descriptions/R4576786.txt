Beautiful top floor apartment in the heart of the old town of Estepona. This 2 bed flat has just been reformed and gives you a fantastic view over the old town and the Mediterranean Sea. The apartment comes with a spacious salon and an open plan kitchen as well as 2 bedrooms and a very nice bathroom with a walk-in shower, which gives enough space for a bigger family. The rental possibilities are fantastic and all bars and restaurants are just a stones throw away.
From the balcony you can enjoy the sunset. The roof terrace invites you to relax, sunbath or just read a book. It has easy stairs but no Lift!
