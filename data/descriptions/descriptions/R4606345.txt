Situated in Nueva Andalucia's coveted El Dorado community, this duplex penthouse epitomises elegance and practicality. With two stories and three bedrooms and three bathrooms, the property is elegantly designed in the modern Scandinavian style. 
Featuring high-end Smeg equipment, the ground floor kitchen is light and airy and flows smoothly into the living space, which has doors opening to a south-facing patio. A dining table, a bar table and a BBQ area complete this area that looks out into the large communal pool.
There are two bedrooms on the equally beautiful upper level, each with its own private bathroom.
The walk-in closet-equipped master suite leads out to a heated plunge pool and a balcony with expansive views of the sea. Designed for afternoon lounging, the second bedroom features a peaceful west-facing balcony with views of the mountains.
Three terraces—two facing south and one west—as well as a community garden with a sizable pool enhance outdoor living. Two underground parking spaces and a gated community for security are additional perks of the property. Fully furnished in a contemporary style, the penthouse has impressive rental records, with first occupation license (LPO), as well as a tourist rental license in place.
The position is unrivalled, close to Centro Plaza and all of its restaurants, supermarkets, and shopping centres. Walking distances to Puerto Banus and the beach are available, and there is a little community fee. This El Dorado duplex penthouse is more than simply a place to live for people looking for luxury, practicality, and significant rental investment possibilities.
