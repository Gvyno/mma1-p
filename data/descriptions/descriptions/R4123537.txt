Top modern 3 bedroom corner apartment with stunning sea view in Puerto del Almendro.

This home offers 3 bedrooms (master bedroom en-suite) and 2 bathrooms, all in modern Scandinavian style. It has an open floorplan, connecting the kitchen with the living room, leading directly to the south/southwest facing terrace with a bespoke barbeque area. There is also an ethanol fireplace in the living room.

It has recently been refurbished to the highest standard, with a focus on design and functionality. The master bedroom has its own bathroom, a small walk-in closet as well as a makeup area. There is a sea view from two of the bedrooms, and all bedrooms have their own fitted wardrobes. 

Both bathrooms have wall-hung toilets, integrated pipes, and underfloor heating. The kitchen appliances are Bosch, and there is also filtered, drinkable water from the kitchen tap! There is central heating, with different Airzones in each room.

There is easy access to the apartment, and the entrance feels more like a townhouse than an apartment. Easy parking in front.

The community has cameras, a beautiful pool, and a pool area that gives you that "vacation feeling" as well as a tennis court. The entrance to the urbanization is currently under construction and is being slightly changed. The new road will have a sidewalk to the Los Halcones commercial center, so you can easily reach several restaurants, supermarkets, a pharmacy, etc by foot/bicycle!

Los Almendros is located right above San Pedro de Alcantara, and approximately an 8-minute drive to Puerto Banus.
