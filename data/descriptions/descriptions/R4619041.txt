The best location! Spacious semi-detached house, with six bedrooms, located in a beautiful urbanization in Nagüeles. Located on the Golden Mile and just 10 minutes by car from Marbella.
The complex has lush gardens with a large community pool, where you can enjoy the fabulous climate of the Costa del Sol outdoors.
It faces the Southwest, thus taking advantage of the greatest amount of light throughout the year, making it a warm and well-lit property.
The house is distributed over four floors: on the main floor there is a large living-dining room with fireplace, kitchen, toilet and a comfortable terrace with direct access to the garden and community pool.
The first floor consists of 3 bedrooms, one of them with an en-suite bathroom with a jacuzzi bathroom and terrace. The other two rooms share the second bathroom.
The second floor offers a large room that can be used as a gym, games room, office or bedroom.
The basement consists of two more rooms, also with a shared bathroom and a closed garage with space for two cars, with the convenience of having direct access to the house.
A few kilometers away we find Puerto Banús, Marbella town and Estepona, where you can enjoy its beaches, marinas, golf courses, gastronomy and all kinds of activities.
