This extraordinary 3-level villa has been designed for those who appreciate comfort, peace and being close to nature. The unique location of this house makes it even more special and able to satisfy the most sophisticated tastes and needs. The main goal of this project is to fully integrate the house with the landscape and make it as functional as possible, making it full of natural light at the same time. The house also gives an opportunity to enjoy the magnificent views from every room and the natural surroundings of the villa while having a rest at the pool area. An additional advantage of this property is definitely its setting in a prestigious location of the Spanish Costa del Sol, in a closed residential community equipped with cameras, which guarantees high security. 

On the first level of the house there's a spacious living room with a dining area and a direct exit to the terrace and the pool. There are also all the three en suite bedrooms on the same level. The master bedroom with an integrated cloakroom and a 10m2 bathroom and the other two bedrooms with smaller bathrooms and huge built-in wardrobes. On the second floor there is a 24m2 gym and a solarium terrace. On the top level there are parking spaces for 2 cars. The villa is equipped with an elevator  to reach each level of the house easily.
