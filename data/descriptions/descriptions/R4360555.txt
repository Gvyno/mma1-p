Excellent opportunity to acquire a 600m2 corner plot with a charming rustic villa of 149m2. The property features an entrance hall that leads to a spacious hallway and a generous living-dining room with High ceilings and direct access to a large covered porch/terrace offering beautiful views of the extensive garden, where a swimming pool can be built. From the living room, you can access two guest bedrooms with built-in closets and a shared bathroom in the hallway. Through the entrance hallway, you reach an independent kitchen with a closed terrace/laundry area and direct access to the garden surrounding the house. The hallway also provides access to the ample master bedroom, which boasts a full ensuite bathroom and a walk-in closet. From this bedroom, there is access to another terrace that surrounds the property.
Additionally, the property includes a ground floor garage and an independent apartment, ideal for guests or service personnel, featuring 1 bedroom, a living-dining room with an open kitchen, and a bathroom with a shower. This apartment has direct access to the garden.
While the house is old and in need of renovations, this property presents a compelling opportunity for an investor, whether to undertake a complete renovation or to build a new villa on the existing plot. The urban characteristics allow for the construction of a ground floor plus one additional floor, and even a basement is permitted. In accordance with the regulations of the 1986 Marbella General Urban Planning Plan (PGOU-86), the minimum required plot size is 500m2, with a building capacity of 0.35m/m2 and a maximum occupancy of 30%.
The property enjoys an excellent location in the renowned area of El Real Panorama, within walking distance of the exclusive La Finca de Marbella urbanization. It is a very peaceful residential area, just a 3-minute walk from the beach, the promenade, and the new Mediterranean Park. The latter is an important ongoing project expected to be completed later this year. The park will encompass 40,000m2 of natural space, connecting with the promenade. Moreover, it will be one of the largest beach sports facilities in Andalusia, featuring five beach volleyball courts, three beach soccer fields, one beach handball court, yoga areas, and a large children's zone.
The property is also within close proximity to Marbella, a 35-minute walk along the promenade, and a 5-minute drive to Marbella, 10 minutes to Puerto Banús and San Pedro, and 15 minutes to Estepona.
The house has beautiful views of the iconic mountain of Marbella, "la Concha".
