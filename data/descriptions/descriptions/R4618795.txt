"Unique development property in the heart of Marbella Old Town
- Rare opportunity to acquire a town house with generous floor-to-ceiling heights and plenty of southern European charm

Fantastic town house located in the heart of Marbella Old Town, very close to Plaza de los Naranjos and Calle Ancha, and within walking distance of the beachfront. Combining the quaint and authentic atmosphere of Old Town with proximity to the vibrant boardwalk, restaurants, cafés, and more, this location provides easy access to all that Marbella has to offer. Still on a calm and quiet street.
The property sits on a land plot of 83 m2 and the current building comprises two storeys with an option for a third storey with a sun-soaked roof-top. In addition it has a private inner courtyard. The building has a spacious feel with generous floor-to-ceiling heights and plenty of natural light.
The current owners have prepared ambitious and high quality development plans for the property, with the intention of creating a unique and exclusive home. The development plans have been designed by a well-renowned local architect, focusing on efficient and modern layouts while still paying tribute to the heritage of the building. See pictures. The plans can easily be changed to 2 or even 3 smaller apartments.
All regulatory requirements for the proposed development are in place and have been approved but the final license document is still pending. At the moment the house is sold as is.
