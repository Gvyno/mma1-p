Set in a vast expanse of 7,000 square meters, this stunning Villa offers a serene haven dotted with an abundance of fruit-bearing trees, assuring complete seclusion and breathtaking all-encompassing views of the surrounding mountains and sea.

The estate encompasses a built area of 311 m2, with the living quarters spanning 251 m2.

Ideal for those yearning for expansive outdoor living, this residence could serve as a quaint bed and breakfast, an idyllic site for wine tastings, a serene yoga sanctuary, or a welcoming homestead for gatherings of friends and family. Constructed in 1990, the villa has been meticulously maintained by its original owners and is located in a peaceful enclave just a brief 5-minute drive from the village of Mijas Pueblo. Over the years, numerous enhancements have been made, particularly to the gardens which have been transformed into a lush tranquil park complete with its own exclusive bar.

The approach to the villa's dual-level structure is through an elegant, secure driveway that leads to ample parking capable of accommodating several vehicles, in addition to a detached 48 m2 garage. On the ground level, there are two comfortably sized bedrooms featuring built-in storage and private ensuite bathrooms. Each bedroom affords its own direct access to the beautifully maintained garden, sunny terraces and inviting pool area. The kitchen, recently updated with modern Neff appliances and Scandinavian-inspired decor, opens to a dining space warmed by a cozy fireplace, from which there is also terrace access. A grand marble stairway at the house's entrance escorts you to the upper floor, where you are greeted by the grandeur of the master suite, boasting an ensuite bathroom and an extensive balcony which frames the amazing mountain & sea views.

The property originally consisted of two separate plots that have since been combined, ensuring a buffer from neighbors and the opportunity to construct additional structures or outdoor amenities to taste. A section of the grounds is designed as an impressive meadow featuring a bar, forging an inviting spot for social gatherings. An elegantly designed pathway meanders through the gardens to the bar area, set amidst the orchard. It's a slice of paradise tailor-made for hosting events.

The gardens are equipped with a sophisticated irrigation system, and the perimeter is fortified with a newly erected, robust fence designed to deter wildlife. The outdoor lighting system is strategically placed along walkways and within the trees to provide a magical ambience as evening falls.

Mijas Pueblo, the white village, sits in the foothills of the Mijas Mountains some 428m above sea level. The village provides some of the most stunning and breath-taking views of the surrounding areas down to the coast and inland the rugged rocky landscape which this Property showcases!
The village is not only very popular with tourists visiting for the day or vacationing but with local residents from nearby towns and villages. The attraction of Mijas Pueblo is the authenticity the villages provides of the Spanish way of life, from its cobbled streets, white washed walls and array of artisan shops and boutiques. Many traditional festivals are celebrated from the main plaza (square) located centrally in the Pueblo.
With in excess of 320 days of sunshine a year, you are practically guaranteed perfect weather for a BBQ or to enjoy a long leisurely lunch sampling some of the best food and drink the Mediterranean has to offer!
