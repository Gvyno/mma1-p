Impressive opportunity to acquire a plot in Altos de Valderrama, Sotogrande. It is a corner plot with a slight southwest orientation. The west edge faces the green area so it is well separated from neighbors. The only neighbor to the south is much lower, so the plot is quite bright. It has a good number of cork oaks that are wonderful.
