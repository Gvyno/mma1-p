This beautifully characterful, and very private detached villa is situated in a lovely, quiet residential area on the very edge of the Marbella town centre (9 min walk). This charming house has been designed around a central courtyard which allows light to flow through the entire property. The distribution has been very well thought through, with the main floor consisting of a large "L" shaped living/dining room with fireplace, which leads out to the south/west facing terrace overlooking the pool area. The kitchen, with its separate laundry room, also has direct access to the terrace. Furthermore, you have a bedroom with an ensuite bathroom, a music room, a study, and an art studio on this level. The upper level consists of five bedrooms, including the enormous master suite with two walk-in wardrobes and a dressing room. From this level, you also access a roof solarium from which you can enjoy the panoramic views of Marbella all the way down the Mediterranean coast to Gibraltar. The lower level has underground parking for several cars. The property has been finished with considerable attention to detail, with underfloor heating throughout. The villa has been furnished with exquisite antiques that can also be acquired with the property.
