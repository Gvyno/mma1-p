This is an exceptional property which will be very sought after. Rarely does a property of this nature become available. It is situated about a 5 minute drive from Alhaurin El Grande with close proximity to the main road. It is made up of 3 segragated portions all with access to the road. One part has the house on it and the others are completely separate however all sold together at this point giving the owner options once purchased. Each part has it's own water and electricity supply. Big villas have been built right along the road making it a very desirable location to make it your family home with plenty of private land around it and outbuildings. The house would need updating to your requirements.
