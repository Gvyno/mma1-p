Each of the four bedroom suites boasts its own luxurious bathroom and independent Domotics, while the master suite offers a sauna and Jacuzzi for ultimate relaxation.

The property is also equipped with an office, guest toilets, laundry room, and storage, as well as ample parking including a marine vehicle garage conveniently located next to the beach gate. Cutting-edge technology systems ensure maximum security and comfort, while the outdoor entertainment areas, including a home cinema, fitness area, and al fresco dining patio, provide endless opportunities for relaxation and enjoyment.

Outside, the blue and white palette blends seamlessly with the natural surroundings, creating a sense of tranquility and elegance that Jackie Kennedy herself would have admired. With panoramic sea views and direct beach access, privacy and serenity are guaranteed in this coastal paradise.

Situated between Fuengirola and La Cala de Mijas, the property offers easy access to amenities, international schools, and recreational activities, making it an ideal holiday or permanent home in one of Europe&#039;s most sought-after locations. Luxury comes at a price, but in this case, every penny is well worth it for the chance to own a piece of paradise on the Costa del Sol.
