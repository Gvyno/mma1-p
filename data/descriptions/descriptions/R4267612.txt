Now your 2-bedroom apartment in Fuengirola only 200m to the beach!
This is a beachside paradise! Picture this: a charming 2-bedroom apartment that's just a hop, skip, and a jump away from the sea. Located on the seventh and final floor of the building, I like to call it my "seventh-floor sanctuary."
As you enter, you'll be greeted by a bathroom on your left. Now, I know what you're thinking, "Who needs two bathrooms?" Well, trust me, it's a lifesaver when you have guests over and nature calls simultaneously. 
Moving on, we have a fully fitted kitchen with a laundry area. Because why not multi-task your culinary adventures with laundry day? Just imagine the aroma of fresh laundry mingling with the delightful scent of sizzling bacon. It's an olfactory symphony.
But wait, there's more! The bright living room opens to an 8 m2 terrace. Ah, the terrace—my gateway to partial sea views and which is closed with glass windows to enjoy all year round!
Now, let's talk bedrooms. Two cozy retreats with fitted wardrobes await you. From the master bedroom you just hop off your bed to the terrace for your morning coffee!
Last but not least, the apartment comes with hot and cold air conditioning, marble flooring throughout and an underground garage space! And the cherry on top? The location! You'll enjoy all the perks of living in the heart of Fuengirola. Need groceries? Supermarkets are at your service. Want to explore the area? Urban and interurban buses are ready to whisk you away. Feel like taking a day trip? The train is at your disposal a few minutes' walk, which can take you directly to the Málaga Airport. Everything you could possibly need—shops, pharmacies, banks, restaurants, bars, schools, institutes, nurseries, and even a health centre—are within arm's reach.
And…. AHHHH, THE BEACH! Just a mere 200 meters away, it's your playground, your escape, and your happy place. Spend your days basking in the sun, building sandcastles, or playing "spot the tourist" as they struggle to pronounce "Fuengirola."
The perfect match for either a permanent or holiday home and, off course, an excellent rental investment!
