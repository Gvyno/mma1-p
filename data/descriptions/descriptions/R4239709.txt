Fantastic semi-detached villa for sale in Los Patios de Valderrama, Sotogrande. You enter the property through a small private patio which leads to the entrance hall. From this hall you have access to the kitchen, lounge and the sleeping area. The fully equipped kitchen with amongst others a large wine fridge has been opened up to the former formal dining room from where you also have access to a private patio. The living room also gives access to the patio and a covered terrace with views over the garden and swimming pool. As the lounge has large windows from both sides it is very bright. On this floor are also 3 bedrooms, each with its en-suite bathroom. Going down one floor we can find a large bedroom with en-suite bathroom and access to the terrace and a storage room. 2-car garage.
The property has been completely reformed by the current owner, maintaining the original charm such as the brick floors, but adding solar panels, new kitchen, 4 new bathrooms, gym with bathroom, outdoor bar with BBQ, heated salt water swimming pool and a Jacuzzi. The very private garden is easy to maintain.
Great property for golf lovers as it has direct access to the Valderrama course, low maintenance so you can dedicate much time to playing golf.
