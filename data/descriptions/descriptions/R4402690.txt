Puerto Banus reform property.

A very interesting opportunity for the creative minded client looking for a reform project in a fantastic discrete location within walking distance in to the heart of Puerto Banus.

The existing layout consists of a good sized lounge with an open plan kitchen to the rear. There is master bedroom with ensuite bathroom,two secondary bathrooms that share another bathroom.

The property benefits from lots of terraces one leading from the main lounge,another is accessed via the rear bedroom and the main terrace is off the lounge. The property also benefits from a full solarium which could be utilised in many ways.

The semi detached property sits within it's own private grounds that are currently set largely as patio.
