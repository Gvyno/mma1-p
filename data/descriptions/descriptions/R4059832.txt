Craft Your Dream Oasis: Whole Plot or Subdivided Options
This exceptional 2,939 sqm plot presents a unique opportunity to secure a prime location for your dream villa. Owning the entire plot maximizes your privacy, guarantees unobstructed panoramic sea views for ever and allows for a more expansive living space with unmatched outdoor possibilities. For those seeking a luxurious estate, acquiring the whole plot is our strongest recommendation.

However, we also understand that some may prefer a more manageable footprint. The option remains to choose just one of the two generous subdivided plots.

1.869m2 plot (panoramic sea view) 400€/m2 = 747.600€ plus VAT
1.070m2 plot (partial sea view) 400€/m2 = 428.000€ plus VAT

Both plots together:
2.939m2 plot (panoramic sea view) 400€/m2 = 1.175.600€ plus VAT
