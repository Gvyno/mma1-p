To find a 4 bedroom with a good sized plot and great "bones" under 1m EUR in the B Zone (Sotogrande Costa), is increasingly more difficult.

This property offers a great family home and with a few modifications in time, it could be a great investment due to the fabulous location. In fact, the property has the ability to be expanded in 3 directions. 

The property is fairly priced with 283m2 built (as per cadastral) and a plot well above 1000m2 as well as 4 bedrooms and a private pool.

The outside area is well defined with different spaces to sit out and enjoy the Spanish sun, including a large terrace area just off the living room, as well as an outdoor kitchen and entertaining area.

The master suite offers privacy as it is the sole bedroom on the 2nd floor. All the other 3 bedrooms are on the ground floor making the property a very easy home to get around as you get into your later years.

Ultimately, the location is what many customers seek. Easy access to all that Sotogrande has to offer as well as walking distance to Paniagua for dinner/drinks (soon to be overhauled into a charming commercial area) as well as 20 minute walk into Pueblo Nuevo.

There aren't many 4 Bedroom B Zone villas on the market so viewings are recommended. The owner will listen to offers as she appreciates the kitchen needs updating.
