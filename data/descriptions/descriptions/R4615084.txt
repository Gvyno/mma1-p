Ground floor apartment with 2 large double bedrooms and 2 full bathrooms. The house offers a cozy living room and a separate kitchen, both recently renovated for greater comfort. It stands out for its private entrance and the exciting perspective of a 160 square meter private garden/terrace in the process of transformation. Intermediate walls will disappear to create an attractive open space. The advertised price reflects the current state of the property, but there is the option to purchase the fully finished garden for an additional 15,000 euros. We invite you to discover this unique opportunity!
