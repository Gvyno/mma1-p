This plot of 5000 m2 in the area of EL PADRÖN, in Estepona, is a true treasure that boasts a series of outstanding features, making it a unique opportunity.

The plot offers breathtaking views of the sea and mountains, with a partial view of La Concha. The privileged location of the property ensures that these views will remain intact in the future. Situated on the serene slope of the Rio Padron, this land provides a tranquil natural environment and enhanced privacy. The perimeter walls defining the property are already built, adding security and privacy.

The plot features a lush garden that adds a special touch to the property. Surrounded by fruit trees including oranges, lemons, avocados, olives, mandarins, pomegranates, persimmons, pears, as well as pines and palm trees, this garden is a true oasis that offers not only visual beauty but also the opportunity to enjoy fresh fruits directly from your own land.

The land has its own well, along with membership in an irrigation community, ensuring economical and efficient watering. Maintaining this garden in its mature splendor becomes a worry-free reality.

It's important to note that a new structure cannot be built on the plot; only the reform of the existing structure is allowed, following the restrictions outlined in Estepona's Urban Planning regulations. The plot comes with a project that the future owner could use. There's a pre-constructed pool on the plot, and its location could be adjusted according to the buyer's needs.

With the possibility of renovation, the property could reach a living area of 343m2, in addition to terraces and additional space in the basements, all on an extensive 5,000m2 plot. This provides a wide range of design and expansion opportunities.

Furthermore, the plot is just a 5-minute drive from the entrance of Estepona and the new Laguna complex, Beso Beach, making it an attractive investment. If a quality property is built on this land, it will undoubtedly become a solid long-term investment.
