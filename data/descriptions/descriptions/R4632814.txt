Spectacular villa with 4 bedrooms and 4 bathrooms and 1 toilet divided in 3 floors. From the ground floor it offers partial sea views and from the first floor and solarium it offers spectacular sea, mountain and golf views. Very spacious basement with garage and space for several cars.

Valle Romano is located in one of the world's main tourist destinations – in the municipality of Estepona, right on the Costa del Sol, in the south of Spain. Estepona enjoys an exceptional climate, with mean temperatures in spring of 21º C, summer 25º C, autumn 16º C and winter 14º C. This climate is ideal for practising golf throughout the year and for this reason, the widest range of golf courses in Europe is concentrated in this region.

Furthermore, Valle Romano is close to large centres of population such as Marbella, Malaga, Ronda, Sotogrande, Algeciras, Gibraltar and Seville.
