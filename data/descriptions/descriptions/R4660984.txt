Welcome to this elegant and luminous villa located in Pueblo Andaluz, in the heart of La Resina golf course in Estepona. Pueblo Andaluz is a well-maintained urbanization consisting of 20 detached villas. There is a large shared saltwater pool and a lush tropical garden.

The residence is less than 10 minutes by car from the center of Estepona, 12 minutes from Puerto Banús, and less than 15 minutes' walk from the beach and Sonora Beach Club. In addition, a new padel club is being built nearby, with a restaurant, spa and gym that can be reached in just 10 minutes' walk from the residence.

For families, this is an excellent choice, mainly thanks to the proximity to the Atlas American School of Málaga which can be reached in just three minutes by car, as well as the Swedish International School in Cancelada which can be reached in seven minutes by car.
