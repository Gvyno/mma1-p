Fantastic corner penthouse surrounded by a 190m2 terrace on a first line of the Calanova Golf course with panoramic views.
The apartment has 2 bedrooms, one is ensuite. The kitchen is open onto the living room which leads the spacious terrace partly glazed so you can enjoy it all year round. The views are panoramic and spectacular.
The gated Urbanization offers a nice communal swimming-pool and very well kept gardens. The apartment is sold with an underground parking and a storage room accessible with the elevator.
The apartment is at the moment connected to the next door apartment which is also for sale in case you want to join the 2 to make an impressive 4 bedrooms penthouse.
