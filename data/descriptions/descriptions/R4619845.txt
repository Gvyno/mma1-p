PRIVATE DETACHED VILLA WITH SEAVIEWS NEAR AMENITIES

A rare opportunity to purchase a lovely villa in a small community in Calahonda, 15 minutes from Marbella. Right in the countryside but very convenient situated near to the shops, restaurants, sports facilities and only around 1 km easy walk to the beach. Situated on a corner and has therefore great privacy. 

On the street level we have the garage and storage with electric gate. We walk up some external stairs and enter the hallway with on the right the south facing living room with fireplace and direct access to lovely terrace with garden and sea views and views of the urbanisation. 

Opposite the living room we have the lovely large kitchen and breakfast/dining room with direct access to the garden and views towards the hills and beyond. We also have another room used as an office but could also be turned into the 4th bedroom.  Further on the same floor we have a separate guest toilet and the master bedroom with a large en-suite bathroom. Also, direct access to the south facing terrace. 

On the first floor we have 2 double bedrooms with a shared large bathroom and access to a very large south facing terrace with open panoramic views. 

A lovely small and international community with 6 villas in total which share a swimming pool and the gardens. Very well maintained and a delightful established area for easy living.
