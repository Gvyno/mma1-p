This gorgeous apartment is bright and spacious, on an elevated ground floor. It has two lovely terraces, one covered facing the beautiful gardens with mountain views, and a larger one that can also be used for entertaining or for quietly sunbathing on a warm summer day. The two bedrooms are large, and come with ample built-in wardrobes. Both have spacious en-suite bathrooms. The kitchen is also quite large and fully equipped, with a separate pantry and laundry area. 

There is an underground parking with plenty of parking space, a storage room and a lift that leads directly to the apartment floor. The community is stunning, with several swimming pools (one of them heated!), beautifully maintained gardens with grown trees, palm trees and subtropical plants, and easy access to the Clubhouse restaurant, which serves a wonderful selection of high-end  food and drinks and even regularly themed event nights that you will not want to miss.

La Mairena is home to the famous Hofsass German Tennis Academy and two very popular International schools, making the area perfect for a family with school-age children. The Kudu Bar is a very contemporary and modern bar featuring a lovely terrace with outstanding views of the entire coast. A great place to enjoy a relaxing drink or take the opportunity to eat from the very tempting menu.

El Soto de Marbella also has its own nine-hole golf course, gym, sauna, spa, tennis courts, paddle tennis, petanque and children's play area. Certainly more than enough to entertain the whole family.

A few minutes drive away is Elviria, which not only has the best beach in Marbella, but also a variety of restaurants, bars and beach clubs, including the world famous Nikki Beach.  Nearby is the La Cala Golf complex, the largest in Spain with three full length courses, a six hole course and a David Leadbitter academy and driving range.
