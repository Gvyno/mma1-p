A small development of 4 houses in the hills behind Estepona but just a 10 minute drive to the centre and beaches.
Each house has 4 bedrooms all ensuite, guest toilet, large basement which can hold 3 cars or could be converted into a 1 car garage and multi use room.
The living room is huge and opens out onto the large covered terrace and garden with private pool and good sea views.
The kitchen has not been fitted and is down to each buyer to make their own choice of kitchen.

These houses are a fantastic opportunity to own a great home at a very competitive price as currently houses in the area which need renovation are selling for more. 
We have keys in the office and can show the houses 7 days per week.
