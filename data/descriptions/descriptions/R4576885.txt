Impeccably presented, this luxurious beachfront apartment is an exceptional and unique opportunity to fulfill your dream of owning a home, whether first or second, with views of the beach and sea. There is no motorized traffic, just people walking along the boardwalk, the sound of seagulls crying, chatting and the opinions of the waves whether strong or humble. The most spectacular panoramic sea views you can imagine will allow you to contemplate the passing of the seasons and the ever-changing colors of this privileged place. The apartment is in excellent condition and could be used as delivered. However, it also allows for the possibility of reconfiguration to meet your personal needs. It is currently part of two equal sized apartments which have been amalgamated and the seller will deliver all amalgamation works completed to a high standard. The seller will become her neighbor since she will continue to own the other apartment. This is not for you if you want to make money from vacation rentals, as this community does not allow short-term vacation rentals. The community is made up of three well-spaced buildings right on the seafront and has a full-size tennis court, two swimming pools and a spacious well-established garden. The apartment itself has a spacious living room, master bedroom, secondary bedroom and bathroom. There is a separate WC with the possibility of making a small bathroom with shower. A fully equipped high quality kitchen. The terrace extends around the apartment giving all rooms views of the sea. There is a private parking space and a large storage room in the basement.
