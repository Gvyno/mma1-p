This large townhouse with separate accomodation sits on the outskirts of the village of Guaro, walking distance into the centre. The building requires finishing off but has the potential of being a large house with separate studio accomodation or even three apartments. There is also a large garage/workshop on the ground floor.

The first floor is comprised of a large living room and bar area, terrace, kitchen and interior patio, double bedroom and bathroom. Upstairs are a further four double bedrooms and bathroom, the master with it's own walk-in dressing area. Most of the bedrooms also have the added benefit of fitted wardrobes. 

The separate studio apartment is located on the top floor. This area is practically finished with a fully fitted kitchen, double bedroom, bathroom, utility room, terrace and open-plan living and dining room.

Guaro is a modest white village, located on the edge of the Sierra de las Nieves natural park. Thanks to its elevated position, at over 350 metres above sea level, the village offers privileged views across the surrounding countryside.


The area is known for producing almonds and olives, which is an important part of the local economy. Guaro has it ́s own olive mill, where locals have their harvests pressed. It is the ideal spot for outdoor lovers, which also offers a few famous cultural activities like the Luna Mora festival in September. Like many white villages in Andalucia, the village dates back to the Arabic occupation of Spain. 


Guaro is located 55 minutes (50 km) from the city of Málaga and the airport and the beaches of the Costa del Sol (Marbella) are only a 35 minute (24 km.) drive away!
