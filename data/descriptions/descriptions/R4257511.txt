Very good investment in the heart of Benahavis This house is very good as a habitual residence or for rent with some very important benefits. It is furnished with everything new including kitchen.
The property does not have a garage but right in front of the house there is a covered garage that all the neighbors can use.
Another important point is that once registered in this town hall of Benahavis the person who is registered has the right to the swimming pool and sports activities.
Benahavis is located in a natural environment surrounded by mountains, rivers, waterfalls and an impressive gastronomic offer with many cafeterias and a very pleasant social atmosphere....
