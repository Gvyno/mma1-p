This is a small project of just eight newly constructed semi detached villas within a gated complex with two entrances and security cameras. 
Each villa is distributed over three or four floors with a contemporary open plan design and floor to ceiling windows allowing lots of natural light throughout these modern homes. All the villas consist of a ground floor, an upper floor and one or two lower floors. All the properties are energy efficient, sound proofed and insulated.
Located in a small and quiet street with wonderful countryside views these houses will be built to a very high standard, with an elevator to each floor, private plunge pools on the terraces and a basement which can be designed to suit the individual buyers requirements. Every house will have private parking and these luxurious homes are due to be finished mid 2023
La Cala Hills is an excellent residential area with some superb restaurants, local shops, sports club and private school. Located close to the very popular Mijas Golf resort and just a 5 minute drive to both La Cala de Mijas and Fuengirola this is a superb area to live full time or holiday.
