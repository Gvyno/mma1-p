We are delighted to present this wonderful Villa for sale in the MIJAS GOLF-LA CALA GOLF area. It is located just 10 minutes by car from the beach. The beautiful villa is beautiful both inside and out, with a rather rustic look.

IMPORTANT: the property is good as an investment for rural tourism rental or for people who like to live surrounded by nature and mountains, work from home and want peace of mind.

Facade and perfectly maintained gardens as can be seen in the photo, outdoor barbecue area and porch. The large pool is one of the strong points of this house.

The house has a perfect location and has views of the mountains and the golf course.

If you want to make a visit, do not hesitate to contact us, there is also the possibility of making a virtual visit.
