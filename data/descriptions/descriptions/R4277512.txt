Four bed semi-detached villa in Casasola
Fully refurbished semi-detached villa in the exclusive and sought-after area of Casasola, near Guadalmina Baja. This beautiful residential area is just minutes away from the beach and the Alhambra del Golf padel club. 
The villa comprises three bedrooms, two bathrooms, one of them ensuite, open plan modern kitchen with dining area, guest toilet, and lounge leading to the covered outdoors dining area and overlooking the landscaped garden and swimming pool. There is an independent en-suite studio in the basement with separate entrance and flooded with natural light. Perfect as a guest room. There is also a carport with space for one car. 
The villa is currently being refurbished to the highest standards with high quality materials, and expected to be completed this June. It would make a perfect holiday home for its proximity to the sea and the popular Marbella and Puerto Banús, but also a permanent home, as it's close to schools, shops and amenities.
