STUNNING ULTRA LUXURY/MODERN APARTMENT in front line Mijas Golf location.  Refurbished to the very highest of standards.  The property consists of a spacious lounge/dining room, modern fully fitted kitchen, master bedroom with en-suite bathroom, another double bedroom with walk in wardrobe (formerly second bathroom, but with all plumbing still in place to easily be made into a bathroom again), a southwest terrace overlooking the immaculately kept communal gardens and swimming pools and a north east terrace overlooking the golf course and mountains.  

Amongst the many improvements made to this property are: fully insulated walls, ceiling and floors for temperature regulation and noise reduction, quality double glazing glass on windows and sliding doors throughout the house, new plumbing and wiring and a feature wood-burning fireplace.  Underground carparking space and store room are also included in the price.  Just 600m to the local mini supermarket, bus stop, and a 5 minute drive to Fuengirola with its beautiful sandy beaches, huge selection of shops, bars and restaurants and just a short walk to local amenities.  Fabulous for holidays and all year round living.  A dream of a property!
