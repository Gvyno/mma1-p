Monda is a pretty, whitewashed village at the edge of natural park Sierra de las Nieves, just 15 minutes from the coast of Marbella.

For a small town, you will be surprised about what this lovely place has to offer. Monda attracts a big group of students each year, as the Marbella Design Academy is situated on the outskirts of the village. There are quite a few bars, restaurants and even two clubs for the younger generation, which are always busy! 


The village has everything you need, and more: a small supermarket, local bakery, pharmacy, vet clinic, weekly fruit market and did we mention the churros truck on Sunday mornings? The community pool is just a 5 minute walk from the centre of town and if you continue walking, you can explore the beautiful national park Sierra de las Nieves. This is the ideal place for hiking, biking, motor crossing and horseback riding.


Monda is 30 minutes (37 km) from the city of Málaga and the airport. The coast of Marbella is only 15 minutes (15 km) away.
