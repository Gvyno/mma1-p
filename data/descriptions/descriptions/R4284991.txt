Brand new duplex groundfloor appartments in the heart of Estepona just a few metres away from the beach

Description
Beautiful newly built ground floor duplex in the centre of Estepona, two minutes away from the new pedestrian promenade and the beach of La Rada.
The building has been completely refurbished, so it is brand new, with very good qualities and a stylish neutral colour palette.
The access to the house is directly from the street into a spacious and very bright living-dining room with semi-open concept kitchen. It has a high ceiling and a feeling of spaciousness.

Built on two levels: ground floor and intermediate floor.
Access through some steps to de first two spacious bedrooms with two bathrooms with shower, one of them en-suite.

On the intermediate floor, with access from the living room, are the remaining two bedrooms with en-suite bathrooms. The bathrooms have walk-in showers and beautiful and functional elements, such as taps and fittings.
All rooms are equipped with TV and telephone sockets, as every detail has been thought of, and a double bed can be placed in each room.

The location of the property is exceptional, in a quiet street with flower pots but within walking distance of Calle Real, the most commercial street in Estepona and the new Paseo Marítimo, as well as the wonderful beach of La Rada.
It is also a short term investment, as the area is already gaining in value due to the brand new landscaped gardens and pedestrian area.
A few metres away there is a huge car park open to the public.

You have to visit it to get the feeling of comfort and modernity that you get as soon as you enter, in contrast with the tradition and charm of the village.

An unique opportunity.!
