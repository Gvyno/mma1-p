The idyllic village of Yunquera sits between El Burgo and Alozaina on the Ronda – Málaga road. Entering the relatively large village, peace and tranquillity meets you. Surrounded by spectacular mountain peaks, which winter snow covers for a few weeks each year, you feel embraced by the beauty of Mother Nature. 

Life in this somewhat excluded village goes at a slower pace. Surrounded by olive and citrus farmers and also home to wine growers, there are many wonderful local products available in the village shops, bars and restaurants. We especially love the fresh baked bread rolls of the local bakery! The authentic streets with some of the most beautiful whitewashed buildings in Andalusia make Yunquera a truly charming place to be.
