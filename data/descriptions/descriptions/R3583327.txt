Beautiful private villa in Riviera del Sol, close to golf overlooking the golf courses and the sea.

The property receives us from its beautiful landscaped entrance. The hall takes us to its spacious living room, with dining room and open concept kitchen with large island. Given its south orientation and multiple windows the property is very bright, bathed all day by the sun. From the living room you can access the porch that precedes the pool as well as the garden that surrounds the house. On this level we also find a full bathroom as well as a bedroom. On the first floor there are two bedrooms with access to terrace and two bathrooms, the main one with jacuzzi. Its large basement is also a parking lot with space for two vehicles and a lot of storage space.

Ideal for lovers of golf and tranquility, just 5 minutes from the beach, supermarkets, restaurants, etc.
