Welcome to this spacious and cozy corner townhouse in El Lagarejo!

There is plenty of space for a creative family with several different spaces to hang out in. 

On the entrance level we first enter a small hall with wardrobes to the left and a guest toilet straight ahead. Directly to the right is the fully equipped kitchen with its own exit to the patio with dining table under roof where we entered.

Further into the house is the living room with space for a sofa group by the fireplace and further into another adjacent room with space for dining table and a creative work corner. From here we go out to a terrace on the left hand with another dining table under roof and an outdoor barbecue. 
Upstairs we find the bathroom and two bedrooms. Outside the far bedroom we find a glazed terrace, which is now used as a painting studio.

The garden is easy to maintain as there is currently an artificial lawn there. On the plot there is a smaller house that is used as a tool shed and for various storage.

This community offers a large and nice pool area.

From this townhouse you walk down to central Fuengirola in 15-20 minutes and there are buses down to town and up to Mijas Pueblo. Nearby there is a pharmacy and a Lidl department store.
