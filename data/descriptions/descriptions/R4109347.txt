Rustic property in Ronda.
The farm has an area of more than one hectare. There are planted olive trees, and fruit trees. The construction has part of the house and a restaurant, at the foot of the road between Ronda and Setenil de las Bodegas. The plot is level and has panoramic views from any point of it.
Due to its size, location and construction, it can be perfect to refurbish as rural accommodation.
