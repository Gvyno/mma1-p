This renovated 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom apartment is situated on a high floor, offering breath taking views that stretch from Benalmadena all the way through to the west side of Fuengirola. Previously a 3-bedroom unit, the apartment has been transformed to provide a spacious living and dining area, creating a more open and contemporary living space.

One of the standout features of this apartment is its unique terrace. The terrace is divided into two sections, with one half being glazed in and the other half remaining open. This configuration gives you the flexibility to enjoy the outdoors or retreat to a partially enclosed space, depending on your preference and the weather conditions. This thoughtful design ensures that you can fully appreciate the stunning views while maximizing the use of the terrace throughout the year.

In addition to its impressive features, the apartment's location is highly convenient. It is just a mere 10-minute walk to the beach, allowing you easy access to the coastal amenities and beautiful shores. Within the same short distance, you'll find Miramar, a popular commercial shopping centre, offering a wide range of shops, restaurants, and entertainment options. Moreover, the apartment is also conveniently situated just a 10-minute walk from the centre of town, ensuring that you have easy access to various services, amenities, and local attractions.

Overall, this renovated 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom apartment offers not only stunning views and a spacious living area but also a unique terrace design and a highly convenient location close to the beach, commercial centre, and town center.
