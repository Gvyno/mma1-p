Nice apartment very well located in San Pedro beach with south orientation. Very sunny.
It has a large living room overlooking a large park. 2 large bedrooms and 2 bathrooms, kitchen and laundry room, subway parking space.
Very familiar community. With all services on foot and access to the promenade and the village of San Pedro in a few minutes walk. Puerto Banus is very close.
Ideal area both to live and to get profitability in rent.
Tourist rentals are not allowed in the community.
Very good as an investment as it is located in an area with a great shortage of properties in which prices will never stop rising.
The complex has communal garden and swimming pool.
