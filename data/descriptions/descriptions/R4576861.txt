Teatinos Urban Land. 120.000 m2 of land with approved Partial Plan and Sectorized.
Dear collaborators, I have just captured this land directly from the property.
They are approximately 120.000 m2, of land that are sold directly from the property, and these give directly to the road that is already urbanized in front of Soliva del Cañaveral.
It is the expansion area of Malaga Soliva del Cañaveral area.
And with good payment terms. deferred payments and flexibility in negotiation.

Excellent opportunity for developers.
