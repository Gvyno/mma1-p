Fantastic beachfront property in one of the best locations in Benalmádena Costa, surrounded by all amenities and a short walk from Puerto Marina and the beautiful Parque de la Paloma.
The apartment has 3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, a living room with access to a covered terrace, a large fully equipped kitchen, which opens onto a spectacular 75 m² terrace to enjoy the wonderful sea views, family and friends.
The house is sold with a storage room and a large private underground parking space that is a privilege in the high summer season, in addition the complex has a community parking.
A unique property, ideal both as a habitual residence, vacation residence or as an investment for holiday let, which you should not miss!
