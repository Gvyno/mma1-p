Discover this beautiful apartment located in the Calahonda Royale urbanization. Its location is ideal, just 30 minutes from Malaga airport and on the edge of Marbella. The gated complex has gardens and a swimming pool, and is just a few steps from the beach, with all services close at hand, including restaurants, shops and schools.

The property is made up of two bedrooms and a bathroom, an open kitchen and a spacious living-dining room with a fireplace. It has a large terrace facing south, which provides lots of natural light. And best of all: a private garden with a storage shed and beautiful fruit trees.

Although the home does not have its own parking space, the community has spaces reserved for residents. This is an excellent opportunity for those looking for a holiday apartment or for those who wish to rent one.
