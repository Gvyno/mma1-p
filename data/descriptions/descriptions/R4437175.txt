Great location, less than 10 minutes to the beach, 15 minutes from the airport. Despite being a semi-detached house you don't notice anything, you feel like you are in a detached house. Everything present and busy rented out. Could use some renovation. Very large terrace with covered outdoor kitchen area. room for 4 cars. Swimming pool 8x4 covered but can be opened. 2 bedrooms are in the main house, 1 behind the parking area, by the pool is a small building currently used as a 4th bedroom. 
TOP LOCATION: La Capellania! Provided some refurbishment a good property in a prime location.
