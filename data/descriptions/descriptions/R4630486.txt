Investment Property!

A rare opportunity to invest into a project in Malaga's Centro Historico with all the licenses already approved. 

Situated in the heartbeat of Malaga, this amazing building from the 1800s has been granted permission to be converted into 3/4 individual apartments!

We have obtained quotes from 3 independant construction firms which makes this a very attractive project with fantastic returns in the region of 25-30%

Municipal subsidy granted for the rehabilitation of 87,000 euros
