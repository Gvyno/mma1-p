For sale a lovely 2 bedroom, 1 bahroom apartment on the 5th floor very first line beach, Paseo Maritimo, Carvajal, Fuengirola. This unbelievable building is the best one on the whole long beach promenade because it is facing south and west. On the corner terrace of this apartment you will have sun all day, including the evening sun and you even see the sunset. Yes, that is true! I know you thought that it is impossible on first line beach of Fuengirola, but now you understand how rare this apartment really is.

Both bedrooms have built in wardrobes and double beds. The apartment will be sold partly furnished, so you can move in straight away and start enjoying the most gorgeous sea view of the coast.

The apartment has been completely renovated some years ago. Even the windows are of a high quality and the sound of the waves (that is so relaxing to hear most of the time, but if you are a bad sleeper, it might bother you) does not bother you during the night time.

The modern open plan kitchen is fully equipped and has a window with the best kitchen view you can possibly imagine. From the kitchen you have access to the utility room where you find some storage space and a washing machine.

The community is gated and you have a lot of parking space in the community area. There is also a separate community storage space for bicycles.

It is very easy to access this location since the Torreblanca train station is only 650 m away and the train goes to Malaga airport and city center of Malaga and Fuengirola. Right on your doorstep, along the beach you have dozens of lovely restaurants and shops and cafés, etc.

Community fee  only 65 €/month, garbage tax (basura) 76 €/year and IBI tax 722 €/year for a non-resident and 505 € if you are a resident in Spain.
