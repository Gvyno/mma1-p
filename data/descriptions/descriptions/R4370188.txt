Amazing  4-bedroom house with private garden, garage and basement. 
At the entrance of the house we find the parking area along with some extra, which give a warm feeling to the entrance. Once inside you can find a guest toilet, a fully fitted kitchen and a utility room. The utility room and kitchen could be refurbished into one huge kitchen. 
One the lower level we can find the living room area with fire place. From the living room we can access the garden area. 
On the second floor we can find the master bedroom, two other rooms and a second bathroom. 
On the top floor we find a double en-suite bedroom and a terrace with sea views. 
The garden area is accessed either by the garage or by the living room. We find a lovely chill out area with a vine rack, and a lovely green garden. 
The house also counts with a large 60m2 basement.
