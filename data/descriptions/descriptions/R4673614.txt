Just renovated corner penthouse, right next to the Torrequebrada golf course, in the lovely Golf Resort Torrequebrada community.

So much love has been put into this place, and the best materials have been used, so it's all ready for someone to make it home.
There's a spacious 135 square meters indoors, plus a fantastic big terrace.

The living room is super cozy at 44 square meters, with a fireplace and direct access to the sunny south-facing terrace.

The bedrooms offer beautiful garden views. One even has a walk-in closet.

The master bedroom has its own bathroom with a big 90x180 meter shower, complete with built-in faucets and a window for some natural light and direct access to the terrace. There's also a little dressing room.
In total, there are two bathrooms with showers and an extra toilet.

There's an Airzone remote system for heating and cooling in three bedrooms, the living room, and the kitchen.

Property with LOP.
