This detached house is situated at the end of a quiet cul de sac, and in a totally private and gently sloping plot of over 2000m2 - half an acre in old money! Being in the lower partt of Campo Mijas, it's a nice quiet spot, but far from remote, plenty of amenities are within an easy walk. There is driveway with off street parking and easy fast access from the parking area to the house. The villa is all on one level, and also offers simple access to the private pool. To one side there is an open living area with big American style kitchen, with an L-shaped sofa and patio doors leading out to the pool. There are 2 bedrooms on this side, with a large bathroom which could suit people with reduced mobility. It has both a shower and bath. The other side has a door leading in to the open living space from the garden. There is an arch where the dining table is. There is a large serving hatch into a long kitchen, with plenty of workspace and windows. The 2 bedrooms are spacious. One has patio doors out to the huge garden. Both having en suite bathrooms. An amazing opportunity for anyone wanting to develop their dream home or for a builder wanting to renovate/split the plot and sell on. Whoever you have in mind, this property has a myriad of possibilities. Don´t delay and view today!
