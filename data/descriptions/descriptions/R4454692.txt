Beautiful semi-detached house with south-west orientation in the centre of the village with views of the village, the sea and the mountains.
In excellent state of preservation, it has a living room with dining area, with access to a spectacular terrace that borders the length of the elevation, where you can enjoy the pleasant climate of the area.
On the ground floor there are three bedrooms and two bathrooms, two of which have access to the outdoor terrace on the elevation.
The kitchen, very spacious, with pantry and dining area, provides access by stairs to the upper room, which can be used as a laundry room or dressing room. It leads to the solarium with beautiful views of the mountains, the sea and the village.
The house, very bright and in excellent state of preservation, stands out for its unbeatable location, close to all nearby businesses, restaurants, bars, pharmacy and health centre.
It also has an enclosed garage space, which is a real plus considering its location.
