We are delighted to present this wonderful luxury villa in the heart of the Costa del Sol, just 5 minutes drive from the beach. It is located in the sought after Riviera del sol, a very quiet and safe residential area for family life.

The villa has been refurbished this year 2022, brand new and with all kind of high quality details in every room. The private pool area is still under construction but by the end of December it will be completely finished.

It has a large plot, security cameras and a spacious garage. The basement floor also has a cinema room with screen and armchairs, a gym in the garage and a billiard table.

The house remains furnished. 

It has 5 bedrooms, one of which is currently being used as a wardrobe.
