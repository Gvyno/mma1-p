What an opportunity this is! This is one of the largest and most attractive plots in San Diego and in addition, the plot is south/west facing and you are blessed with unobstructed panoramic views beyond belief, with the rock of Gibraltar as your focal point.  There are so many possiblities for the right owner to create a dream home on this property.  There is a house on the plot, a house in need of extensive repairs , but a better idea is probably to have it removed and build a new, modern villa that ticks all your boxes.
Plots like these do not sell in bulk, so waste no time - Contact us for more info or a viewing.
