Well located three bedroom apartment, located on the ground floor of the urbanisation within a very short distance of the community pool, and enjoying pleasant views of the well maintained and lavishly planted community gardens, as well as the surrounding countryside.

Whilst the property would benefit from some minor upgrades, it remains well presented and nicely positioned.

There are two additional bedrooms which share a family bathroom.  Every bedroom has more than ample wardrobe space.

There is air-conditioning throughout and underfloor heating in the bathrooms.  There is an underground parking space and a store room included in the price of the sale.  The property is presented and sold unfurnished.
