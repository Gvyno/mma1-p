In Elviria, close to the sea and next to golf courses, is this one bedroom jewel of a flat. 

The design of this home is a testament to the harmony between functionality and elegance. The open plan kitchen to the living and dining area creates a flowing and welcoming space for your entertaining and convivial moments.
