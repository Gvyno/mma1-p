Villa in prime location within walking distance to Puerto Banús and on a dead end street.
This villa is situated in a position which is in high demand due to it's central location with all services, restaurants, supermarket, shops, amenities and beach within walking distance.
The villa faces south, has views and is in it's original state so is in need of renovation.
It is a great renovation project and is possible to extend and add on more square meters which would make this a very valuable property.
The property is built on one level and has a garage and a room with independent access.
A great opportunity.
