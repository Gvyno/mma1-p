Amazing 17.051m2 land next to the centre of Benahavís town. 
With many possibilities due to its ideal situation, with only one main entrance and giving privacy and tranquility, on this grand plot we can find two villas.

The main villa has 5 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms. This typical Andalusian house was decorated with an eclectic mix of ethnic and modern pieces, original sculptures and paintings, tiled kitchen and large living room. Boasting a superb shaded barbeque dining terrace, large outdoor auzure pool, all set within more than 4 acres of mature gardens, lawns and woodland.

The second villa consists of a house where it would require the last touches to turn it into a lovely family home.

With amazing views over the village and the Ronda mountains.

Both properties are within walking distance to the town centre with bars, cafes, restaurants... all the day to day needs at your doorstep. And of course surrounded by nature in a lovely, quiet and relaxed enviroment.
