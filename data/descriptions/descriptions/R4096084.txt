Nestled between the golf courses of La Cala Golf and Santana Golf, this well-built finca constructed in 1987 offers stunning green views on a magnificent country plot of 12.000 m2 only 10 minutes drive from a wealth of amenities and the beach at La Cala de Mijas. The property features a large lawn garden and pool with wonderful open views overlooking private meadows with wild flowers towards Santana Golf, with a majestic forest and mountain backdrop. This is truly a nature lover's paradise in an idyllic environment not far from the coast. Upon entry, there is a private gated driveway leading to extensive private parking. Inside, there is a spacious open plan living and dining area with fireplace opening onto the covered garden terrace with wonderful open views, a modern fully equipped kitchen, two large bedrooms, one with en-suite bathroom, and a guest bathroom. The grand entrance hall in traditional style leads upstairs to another large en-suite bedroom + a mezzanine office area. The well built property features aluminium windows, solid wooden doors and carpentry in a traditional finca style, as well as efficient gas central heating. Outside, the substantial lawn garden leads out to a large private swimming pool with private meadows beyond, as well as an out-house for storage and workshop. All in all, this is an excellent opportunity for a very large plot in a stunningly beautiful natural environment only 10 minutes from La Cala.
