TOWN HOUSE IN THE HISTORICAL CENTER OF ESTEPONA
Town house to reform. This home is included in the regulations that allow increasing the buildable area and raising up to 4 levels in one of its areas.
Good investment option to turn it into a charming tourist project or combine it with luxury housing. We offer another attached home with the same characteristics.
Although it is of old construction, the water and electricity pipes have been renewed. The house shows off unique elements and architectural details such as thick pillars and wooden beams. It currently consists of two floors and a large patio, from which you could access the main street.
On the ground floor we find a living room crowned by wooden beams and connected to the small kitchen, the 2 bathrooms, the master bedroom and a hallway that gives access to the laundry room and a bright patio.
Going up some stairs we find another common area with blind windows that face the street and another wooden window that faces the patio. From here there is access to another bedroom and, going up two steps, to a third room with raw walls and ceilings. This last room consists of a wooden balcony with exterior views. .
