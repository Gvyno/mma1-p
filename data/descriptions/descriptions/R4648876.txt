As I open my doors, I invite you to be part of a seafaring dream, anchored in the heart of Puertomarina. My essence merges with the blue of the sea, offering you a life by the beach and within walking distance of the charm of Benalmádena Costa and Torremolinos (Carihuela), where the horizon meets comfort and beauty.

I have recently undergone a transformation, dressed with high qualities that whisper luxury and comfort. My PVC windows, shields against weather and noise, frame serene views with their security double glazing. The wood-look ceramic flooring beneath your feet speaks of strength and warmth, while my white lacquered doors and skirting boards are the perfect canvas for your dreams.

With 115 square metres of spaces designed for living and feeling, including a 30-metre terrace, I offer you nooks and crannies full of light and possibilities. The living-dining room opens onto the terrace, inviting the sun to be part of your day. Two bedrooms, both bright and with access to the terrace, promise rest and privacy, one with the luxury of an en suite bathroom equipped for your relaxation.

My spacious and elegant kitchen is ready to awaken your culinary senses, with silestone finishes and integrated appliances that await your favourite recipes. The promise of practicality and beauty extends to every corner, including parking options right on the harbour, adding convenience to the beauty of living here.

I invite you to discover me, to feel the sea breeze and to be part of this unique enclave. I am one of "the houses that speaks for itself", waiting for you to write chapters of happiness together. Contact us and let me guide you to your new home in Puertomarina.
