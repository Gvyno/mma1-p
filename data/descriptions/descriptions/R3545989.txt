This two story property could be converted into a townhouse or even two small apartments. 

Located on the edge of town, the building has a lovely outlook of the luscious hillside.

The bottom level is accessed via a garage door and the top via some steps, although both could be communicated easily if desired.

The charming white village of Tolox lies against the steep hills of the Sierra de las Nieves, at the end of a side road from the C-344 Málaga-Ronda. It offers beautiful views of the vast rolling countryside below and impressive high mountain peaks above. Tolox is quietly famous for its SPA-waters and one of the gateways to national park Sierra de las Nieves. 

The Tolox SPA (Fuente Amargosa Health Spa) attracts large numbers of pilgrims and SPA-visitors that stay in the area each year. The water is said to work wonders with respiratory ailments due to a mild gas it gives off. Besides the healing waters, the national park Sierra de las Nieves, is a wild and stunning area for rural tourists to discover. The wildlife is impressive and views often breathtaking. 


Tolox is the ideal place to relax and enjoy the slow, peaceful pace of its Andalusian inhabitants. Don't be surprised if you see an old man roaming the streets on its horse or donkey, this is part of the authentic and untouched lifestyle.


Tolox is located an hour's drive (60 km) from the city of Málaga and the airport and the beaches of the Costa del Sol (Marbella) are a 50 minute (40 km) drive away.
