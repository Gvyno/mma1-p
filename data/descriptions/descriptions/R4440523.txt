A very spacious duplex house with lots of outdoor space offering sun and shade all day long. This property has a parking space right outside the front door and you walk in to a roomy, open plan kitchen / diner and lounge with a guest toilet. Outside is a big terrace with great sea views and over La Cala with steps up to an even bigger roof top terrace. Downstairs are 2 bedrooms both with en-suite bathrooms. The master bedroom also has its own large terrace. Immaculately presented, this is definitely worth a visit.
