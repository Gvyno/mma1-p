A fabulous three-bed south-facing bungalow set on its own small plot with a private pool.

The villa has a lovely outside space and covered terrace that would make the most perfect outdoor kitchen and BBQ area. Just imagine relaxing out here and enjoying a dip in your own private pool.

This villa represents a fabulous opportunity. While in need of some renovation, its position and setting are priceless.

There are three bedrooms and two bathrooms, of which one is the ensuite. The lounge/dining area has an open fireplace, perfect for winter nights. The house has a private garage.

The property is only a five minute drive away from Sotogrande with its fabulous Marina with its many bars and restaurants. It is also only a 10 minute drive form La Duquesa and 20 minutes from the bustling Estepona. Fabulously located between two main airports - Gibraltar airport only 20 minutes away and Malaga airport only one hour away.

A fabulous opportunity to make this into a lovely home.
