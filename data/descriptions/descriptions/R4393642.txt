An excellently located and well-maintained apartment in the beloved "Molino del Viento" urbanization in Fuengirola. Within a short walking distance from the beach, the shopping center, the mosque, and the market... in other words, "Location, location, location!" Although the property is currently in good condition, a renovation would undoubtedly be advantageous.
