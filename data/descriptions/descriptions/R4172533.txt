Lovely little gem of a country house situated in a very tranquil area, only a 10-minute drive to Alhaurín el Grande and Coín.

The property comprises 3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, a very bright and spacious living room with cosy log-burning fireplace to warm up the winter nights, a nice good size kitchen with access to an outside wooden terrace. All of this is built on one level on the ground floor.

The basement is where all the potential is, and it really is a "Blank Canvas" that could be converted into a guest apartment for example. Currently it is used for storage. 

The house has easy access and needs some reform work.
