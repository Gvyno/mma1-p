Nice 2 bedrooms/ 2 bathrooms (one en suite) apartment in upper Calahonda with panoramic sea views. Large lounge with a "fire place" an open kitchen and an utility room. The large terrace has a BBQ. The apartment comes with a double parking in the underground garage as well as a storage room. The price does not include the furniture (Optional). The property is in very good condition as it has been very little used. A must See!
