This plot is an amazing opportunity to acquire one of the last available plots for development in the popular Benahavis town. With being in a walkable distance to shops, schools and restaurants, and many other amenities, this location is extremely sought after. This plot of land already has the project plans and license to build 40 modern apartments, each with their own storage rooms and 55 parking spaces.
Each apartment will have their own panoramic view, ranging from sea views to mountain views. These apartments will all have access to a new communal pool, as well as each apartment having their own private, covered terrace. There will be access to underground parking as well as garage spaces.
