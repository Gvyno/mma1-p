Spacious two-storey rural house, located on a large rustic plot planted with orange, olive, almond, custard apple and persimmon trees. To the property also has access to a eucalyptus forest and holm oaks for the production of firewood.

The property benefits from a private heated swimming pool, summer kitchen, workshop, wood store, machine store, 300Mb fibre optic Internet, and an alarm system. The house has air-conditioning throughout as well as central heating radiators heated by a wood boiler with a 2,500 litre manual wood storage tank or automatically by a gas boiler for when no one is at home.

The house itself has 5 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, 2 WC, living room with fireplace and access to a glazed terrace, and a fitted kitchen. It is built with double-layer masonry and fibreglass wool insulation, while the roof in the attic is insulated with insulation boards.

There is also a pump with heat exchanger to heat the swimming pool in case of excess temperature in the heating accumulator. The 300-litre hot water tank is heated by 16m² solar panels or, if there is not enough solar energy, by a gas boiler (6 x 35kg gas bottles in the storage area outside the house). For the irrigation of the garden and fruit trees there is a groundwater pump, which automatically feeds a 16m³ water tank. The lawn and the plot are irrigated by a booster pump and automatic irrigation timers. The fruit trees are irrigated manually by a drip irrigation system.
