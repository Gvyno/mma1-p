Investment opportunity in Arroyo de la miel. 568m2 of parking for sale with capacity for 20 cars. It also has 120m2 of facilities distributed in offices, customer reception room, toilets, etc. Ideal for companies looking to establish offices and need space for several cars, vans or trucks (since the height and width of the premises allow it). As if that were not enough, it also has a totally independent 132m2 villa on the third floor, with an entrance at street level, without communication to the offices and premises (so if they want to put it up for rent, they would have no problem and it would give a extra to the owner). The villa is distributed in 4 bedrooms (3 with very large fitted wardrobes), three bathrooms, separate kitchen, living room and a 430m2 terrace around the perimeter of the house.
 It is a unique opportunity at a price for a quick sale, with a lot of potential to generate extra income for the new owner.
