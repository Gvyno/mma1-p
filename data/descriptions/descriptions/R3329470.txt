Old farmhouse, great character, very large plot and superb views.The main house is around 100 years old and most rooms have exposed beams and wooden panelling.
This old farm property sits on the top of a hill, and enjoys spectacular views all the way to the coast.  The property was extended some years ago, and this was done to match the previous style. The plot is very large at almost 52,000 m2, and the land is predominantly planted with almond trees.  The property is about 20 minutes from the town of Casarabonela, and the main A357 Malaga road can be reached in about 10 minutes.
