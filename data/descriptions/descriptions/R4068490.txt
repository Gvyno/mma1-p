Excellent opportunity to invest in an established Bar and Restaurant of 320 m2 just 10 minutes from Marbesa Beach, on a 2.100 m2 plot with good public transport access.

Marbesa is one of the quietest and most sought-after urbanizations in Marbella, it is located a few meters from the beach and about 5 minutes from Calahonda, it is a great place with a lot of tourism from which you will surely get a great benefit.

The restaurant of 213 m2 has a cozy feel and features a wood burning fire, the large  107 m2 terrace has lovely views and is very private. The fully fitted industrial kitchen , with Gas oven, has further storage rooms and food preparation areas.

The restaurant is within an easy walk to the commercial center of Elviria and the local Beach. Close by is the camping site giving the area a lot of tourists and locals.

The restaurant has been closed for some time and is in need of a complete renovation, but this is reflected in the price. Outside there is covered parking for 2 cars and plenty of uncovered parking for clients and there are also large garden areas.



Early viewing is recommended
