Family townhouse built over two main floors plus a basement with a double garage and a solarium terrace with sea and mountain views. This pretty home is located next to Atalaya Golf, within a gated community of only 18 houses sharing a swimming pool. It is set in a quiet zone with 50 meters walk to the restaurant and club house of Atalaya, a short walk or drive to a shopping center, schools and only a 5 minute drive to San Pedro or the beach.
The ground floor welcomes you through a small porche, and on this level is the living room with fireplace, separate kitchen and utility room (can be opened up to create an open-plan living/dining/kitcehn area), guest toilet and a hallway. The first floor has the master bedroom with en-suite bathroom, two guest bedrooms and a family bathroom. In the basement is a huge garage for 2 cars plus a large room currently used as storage room. The top floor solarium terrace is divided in two parts and offers good views to the mountains and the sea.
This is an excellent good value house, ideal for permanent living or for the keen golfer!
