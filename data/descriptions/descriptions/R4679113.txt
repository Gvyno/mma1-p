Excellent opportunity in the heart of Torremolinos

We couldn't think of a more central location. Right on the Avenida Palma de Mallorca, only a few steps away from the train station and the pedestrian area, with all the restaurants, bars and amenities, we find this tastefully renovated top floor apartment.

The renovation project has been executed in the smartest possible way. As we enter the apartment, we find the bright living area with open-plan kitchen, that leads onto a south-facing terrace, where we have an attractive open urban view with the sea in the back, and we can enjoy the sun most of the day.

Originally with two bedrooms, the current owners have opted the remove the wall that separates the second bedroom with the living room to create a more spacious feeling, although this can be redone easily if needed.
There are two bathrooms that share one shower, accessed on one side by the en-suite on the main bedroom, and accessed through the other side through the guest toilet by the entrance. Again, this can be converted back into a full private bathroom for the master bedroom, and leave the other half as a guest toilet.

As you can see, this renovation has been meticulously planned, maximizing the available space.

The apartment enjoys sun all day as it has two façades.

All the exterior carpentry has been updated to the highest level, providing perfect isolation.
There is also AC.

Due to its unbeatable location, this apartment serves as an excellent tourist rental accommodation, with license in place.

This property is very unique and we strongly recommend viewings.
