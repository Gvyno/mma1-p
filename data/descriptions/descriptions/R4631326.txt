Looking for a rural home close to the village and airport? This cozy property on a plot of over 4000m2 is just a 5-minute drive from the charming village of Alhaurin el Grande and 30 minutes from Malaga airport and the beaches.

The fully fenced plot can be entered through an access gate. There is an alarm-system istalled. At the front door, there is a 20m2 covered area for parking the car. The 125m2 house, with insulated loft, has three bedrooms and two bathrooms, one of which is ensuite. The spacious living room (30m2) is south-facing and receives plenty of natural light through large windows and a terrace door leading to the spacious terrace with a swimming pool. In this living room, there is a pellet stove used for controlling the central heating. From the living room, we enter the 20m2 dining room, and behind it is the spacious kitchen. The master bedroom is a generous 29m2 with its own bathroom featuring a shower, sink, and toilet. The other two bedrooms share a bathroom.

From the kitchen, there is access to a nice porch overlooking the pool and a fully equipped outdoor kitchen. At the back of the pool, a second porch has been built with its own bar. Surrounding the house are lovely terraces to enjoy the mature garden. An irrigation system is installed throughout the entire garden, and there is also a private well! Crossing a small bridge over the stream (usually dry), we reach a flat area that would be ideal for keeping horses. This separate piece of land has an area of 1900m2, and there are already some buildings that could be converted into stables. Currently, there is no horse permit on the property, but possible to obtain one.

A delightful place with a house full of possibilities. Note that the kitchen, bathrooms, frames, and doors are all about 20 years old, and updating these elements would greatly enhance the house.
