Beautiful large townhouse located on a quiet street in the old part of Alhaurín El Grande.

The property is built with excellent quality materials and has been recently renovated on the ground floor with cream marble floors, wood carpentry, fitted kitchen, and double-glazed windows.

The property is distributed over two floors as follows; You enter the property via a large hall that gives access through a beautiful wrought iron and glass door. On the ground floor there is a spacious living room, which opens onto a bright and beautiful dining room followed by a bright L-shaped kitchen with direct access to a very pleasant Andalusian-style patio.

From this patio through a corridor, we find to the right a large bathroom with shower, cabinets, and plenty of storage space. This corridor leads to another pretty little patio with a cave at the back. Also on this floor is a double bedroom and another room that could be used an office, games room or another living room.

On the top floor, the landing gives access to three large bedrooms as well as to a sunny terrace with a WC and a storage/utility room.

This property is in excellent condition, perfect for those looking for a home to move into without the need for renovation. The location is ideal, one step away from all amenities such as parks, schools, bars, cafes, shops, etc.
