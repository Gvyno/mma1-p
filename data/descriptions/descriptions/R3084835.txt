Nice bright Local in Calahonda, 2nd line beach only a few hundred meters from the access to the boardwalk.  This local could  be used as an office, store room,  snack bar, shop .  It was originally used as a bar but presently being rented as a store for White Goods and the present Tenants would be interested in continuing to rent.  There is no problem whatsoever either if the Buyer would like to use it themselves or turn it into another type of business.  Location is excellent .

As you can see there is also a little studio apartment within the premises.

  It is a good investment for somebody looking for a Commercial Premises .     There is another local adjacent which is a launderette and has been there for many years.
