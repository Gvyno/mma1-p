An opportunity to finish the start of this unique Eco-Villa and make it your own. 

The foundation, architectural plans and building license are all in place and included in the price. The plans are available with a solar system for electricity and solar collector for water.

On the actual design you enter a large entrance on street level with large terrace and garage for 2 cars. Going down a level we have the 3 bedrooms with ensuite bathrooms with terraces. The next level down we enter the large living room area , kitchen and dining room with the large terrace with swimming pool and bbq area. There is also an option to add another bedroom and bathroom. A level further down is space for utility room and garden. An elevator is running from the top till the bottom.

The Eco-Villa is situated on a very quiet street facing south west with open view over the small river towards the sea. When you sit on your terrace and look at the sea you hear only tranquility yet you are very near the shops, schools and motorway with connection to the whole coast. This small urbanisation in Benalmádena has a lovely park at this heart and is less than 10 minutes to the beach.
