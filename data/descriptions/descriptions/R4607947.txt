The apartment has two double bedrooms, very spacious, with air conditioning and fitted wardrobes. The master bedroom has a large window offering plenty of light and sea views.
The bathroom, located between the two bedrooms, is newly renovated and has a large shower and window to the outside.
The living room and kitchens are currently separated, but it is possible to reform and merge both areas to increase the feeling of space and brightness.
The spacious living room has access to a sunny terrace with tables and chairs, to enjoy the sun and the views while having a glass of wine or reading a book.
The orientation of the apartment is south, so it is a apartment that has sun during most of the day.
