Super Price on this Gaucín property.

A small restoration project on this 78 m2 property in the heart of the village with a lot of character and potential.

Located in the very center of Gaucín, the property is an old town house to reform, an old building with two floors, possible to build a third.

It has two floors, with a living room, bedroom and bathroom on the ground floor.

On the first floor is the kitchen.

The property is old and in need of attention and a fair amount of upgrading, but is in good structural condition and can easily be made into a really nice property.
