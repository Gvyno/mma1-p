Are you looking for a peaceful and tranquil living experience surrounded by nature? If so, this is it! Located in the area of El Padrón, sheltered between the mountains and surrounded by breathtaking views, this plot has 9000 sq meters of land although part of it, is mountainous terrain, and it includes a water well and system to supply the water, a cultivated plot with a wide variety of fruit trees and a man-made water reservoir. The property includes a 82sqm, basic house with open fire. 

The area of El Padron is known for its natural beauty, making it a popular choice for those seeking a peaceful retreat completely out of the hussle and buzzle of the city but still within easy reach.
The plot flora includes acorns, mangoes, lemons, avocados and figs to cite a few.The house is simple and would benefit from some renovations and upgrades but it is legally registered in the title deeds and the "Certificado de no infracción urbanística" is underway.
Please note that as most campo properties in El Padrón, there is no proper septic system in place for sewage.
This house has been a permanent residence and is now ideal for a nature enthusiast to take it to the next level.
