Good location, next to the Las Lagunas Health Center.
It is a studio with a separate kitchen and bathroom with a large window.
Originally it was a large premises, it was divided and half of it has been changed to housing, leaving the other half as commercial premises with a mezzanine for storage. It offers multiple possibilities.
Very appropriate as an investment. Close to all services.
