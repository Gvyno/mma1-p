This property is not available for viewing until late April 2024.

This end of terrace townhouse allows so much light into your living area. Built over 3 floors,  the house is accessed  from a beautiful, sunny terrace with views to the Mediterranean from the Sa
On entering, the  hallway  brings us to a spacious lounge diner.
Off this lounge we have access to both the upper and lower floors, along with a modern kitchen and guest bathroom.

The kitchen also brings us through to the rear, wrap around terrace. Sun or shade as you wish throughout the day.

There is also a utility area, complete with washing machine and lazy bath area. 

The tiled terrace gives scope to BBQ and entertain guests on balmy Costa Del Sole evenings.

On the upper floor we have 3 spacious bedrooms, all with built-in wardrobes. 

The lower semi basement, currently used as a  parking and storage area, has windows and could very easily be converted to a fourth bedroom, games room or home cinema.
 In recent years, the current owner has rented the property as a holiday let and been very successful. 

The urbanisation has it´s own pool and shops, bars and restaurants are within a 10 minute walk of the property.  PINARES DE SANTANGELO is exceptionally well served by supermarkets, schools, medical centres and places of entertainment. Tivoli World is within 5 minutes, which adds to the appeal for holiday rental buyers.

Now wishing to retire and relax a little more, the property is being brought to the market for sale. 
Get in touch to arrange a viewing.
