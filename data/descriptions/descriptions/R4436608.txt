This beautifully presented apartment is situated in a nice quiet spot, but within walking distance of the beach and all the amenities of Miraflores and Riviera del Sol. The small gated community has a super pool and garden area, and there are lifts to all floors. The apartment itself benefits from a bright sunny terrace with glass curtains, a fully renovated and extended kitchen, a large living dining room , 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. There is hot and cold air conditioning throughout, and a very luxurious feel to the property. This one won't be on the market for long so book an appointment to view as soon as you can....!
