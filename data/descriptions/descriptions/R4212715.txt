Spacious townhouse in the historic centre of Alhaurín el Grande. The property is located on a pedestrian street within walking distance of shops and restaurants and the pretty square in the upper part of town.

The property has great potential to make a small Hostel or B&B business.

It currently has 3 bedrooms (but it could easily be converted into 7 bedrooms), two bathrooms, a WC in the patio, kitchen, living room and several storage rooms with a large orchard at the back of the house, ideal for making a pool and chillout area.

This a great house with a lot of potential and in an excellent location!
