This villa is a rare find simply due to the fact that it is large AND has sea views whilst allowing you to walk everywhere.

The property has 4 bedrooms, 4 bathrooms, in great condition, with a pool and a very large basement/garage.

Torreguadiaro is loved for its bars and restaurants as well as its stunning beach and comfortable walk to Sotogrande port.

The villa is >400m2 built on an 875m2 plot and is south facing.

Whilst being toward the top of Torreguadiaro´s "Colinas del Mar" there is no road noise within the property or on the terrace/garden.

With a motivated seller, the price is very fair per m2 and as such it could be a great family home without having to break the bank!
