Beautiful 3-bedroom townhouse with sea views in Manilva.

This lovely property has an open style kitchen with an island and silestone countertops. It also enjoys a good size utility room. From here we get full view of the large and bright living room with fireplace. It has a dedicated dining area. Through glass doors we access the large terrace with plenty of space for a large dining table and lounging space.

A level up, we find the bedrooms. The master bedroom is spacious. The owners have converted the en-suite bathroom into a walk-in closet. The room has also access to a private covered terrace with spectacular sea and coastal views. 

The other 2 bedrooms have a good size with fitted wardrobes.  They all share a full family bathroom with bathtub.

The property includes a car port for 2-cars.

The residential is gated and enjoys a community swimming pool.

The location is ideal, just minutes' walk from Manilva town and all its amenities: supermarkets, schools, restaurants, etc.  The closest beach is just 5 minutes' drive away and so is Duquesa Port and its attractive promenades surrounding it offer a variety of restaurants, intimate bars and cafes. 
Plus is only one hour's drive from the airport of Malaga and 45 minutes from Gibraltar airport.
