Are you looking for a beautiful, well-kept semi-detached house, with a large garden with barbecue in a residence with a communal pool open all year round? I have the house of your dreams.

The house has two floors:
- On the ground floor, you have an open-plan kitchen with a pantry, a small closet under the stairs where there is a 100L water container; dining room, large living room with fireplace and a toilet. The 62m2 garden surrounds the house and there is a storage room and barbecue area. At the front of the house, there is a large area of 35sqm in which there is currently a hibiscus, a lemon tree and a palm tree. They could be removed to take advantage of this space as a parking area in which two cars and several motorcycles would fit perfectly.

- On the first floor, just in front of the stairs there is a double bedroom with a built-in wardrobe with access to a 11.10sqm terrace with views of the garden and the surrounding area. To the left of the long hallway, there is a bathroom with a bathtub, sink and toilet; and a single bedroom with a balcony.

- On the second and last floor, there is a very spacious master bedroom with built-in wardrobes. There is an access to a 16.57sqm terrace with partial views of the sea and Gibraltar; an en-suite bathroom with bathtub, sink, toilet and a closet in which there is another 100L water container.

The house has reversible air conditioning on the ground floor and in all bedrooms.

The house is very bright with south orientation. The communal pool can be accessed from the garden.
The plot measures 177m2 of which 50m2 correspond to the base of the house.

It is very well located, right in front of the RozaRossa Club (tennis, paddle tennis), just a few minutes walk from the International School of Estepona, bars, restaurants, bus stop, and the beach; about 5 minutes drive from Estepona center.

A must see! I am sure you will love it!"
