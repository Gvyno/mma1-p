This is a great opportunity to purchase a high quality modern apartment in the Marbella area.  The apartment is part off an exclusive complex that shares the facilities of the El Soto Sport club meaning free usage of the gym, tennis courts and a small par three golf course.  The complex has been built by one of the UKs largest building companies that has had a presence in Spain for over 30 years. The apartment has two bedrooms and two bathrooms nad a good sized terrace with nice views. The complex is gated and secure and has nice communal gardens, parking and a swimming pool. This is really a good price for a modern apartment on the costa del sol. 
Fabulous property located in La Floresta, residential complex in La Mairena located near Marbella, only 7 kilometres from the beach of Elviria.
Spectacular surroundings surrounding the complex, it has been declared a biosphere reserve by UNESCO, due to the richness and beauty of the forests of cork trees and pines arranged around La Floresta. Very quiet place as a white and Mediterranean village with large terraces to enjoy the sea views.
The property has great sea and hillside views that must be seen to be appreciated and as it is on the first floor it is very private. Community fees include TV channels and free access to El Soto Sports club with its own nine hole golf course, gym, tennis/padel and popular restaurant & bar.
