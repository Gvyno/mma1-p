We are happy to present this wonderful flat in the area of Los Boliches Fuengirola. Surrounded by all kinds of shops, restaurants and other amenities, this flat is a real marvel.
It has a lovely terrace with a wonderful orientation to enjoy the sun. 

It is only a few minutes walk from the train station and the beach of Fuengirola. The town centre is also only a few minutes walk away. It will not be necessary to use the car.

It is a third floor with lift, recently refurbished with impressive finishes, worth to be seen. It has two bedrooms, living room and open kitchen and a bathroom.
