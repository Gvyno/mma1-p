This is a 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom, master bedroom  ensuite, large sitting/dining room, kitchen and utility room.  From both the sitting room and master bedroom you can walk out to the big terrace which is slightly elevated which makes it more private and just  a few steps down to the really nicely landscaped garden with pool.  

This is a gated complex and walking distance to the beach, and local shops and restaurants.

The apartment also has underground parking and store room.

Location is excellent, easy access to the AP7, the complex is on the beachside of Carib Playa.
