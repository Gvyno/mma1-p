This charming property is a cozy 1 bedroom, 1 bathroom top floor apartment located in the serene El Faro neighborhood. Thoughtfully updated by its current owners, they have cleverly enclosed the terrace area, expanding the living room and creating a more spacious indoor environment. However, you can still savor the outdoor ambiance by simply opening the window doors.

Additionally, a cleverly added extra room, currently accommodating a single bed (with the potential for a bunk bed), transforms this apartment into a 1.5 bedroom living space, offering versatility and extra accommodations.

The apartment boasts breathtaking views of the sea, ensuring you can soak in the beauty of the surroundings every day. Convenience is key, as the property is only a 5 minute stroll away from the bus stop, shops, and the beach.

For residents enjoyment, the complex features a refreshing pool, outside parking exclusively for its residents, and a private garden area complete with a seating area. This property offers a delightful blend of comfort, functionality, and natural beauty in a highly desirable location.
