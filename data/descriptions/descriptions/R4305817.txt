This lovely villa in popular La Capellania Benalmadena has three bedrooms, three bathrooms and beautiful sea views.
A small hill leads up from the street to the house to the entrance, from which also has access to the pool area.
The villa has two floors, and on the entrance floor there is a hall, open-plan living room/kitchen and a complete bathroom with shower. Both the living room and kitchen area have access to the garden and pool area, and the living room also has a fireplace.
On the upper level there are three full-sized bedrooms and two bathrooms. Here is also access to a lovely terrace with a view of both sea and the beautiful environment.
The villa has been partly renovated with a new kitchen, bathroom and light tones, but has retained its Spanish touch on the outside and partly inside. Pool area and patio/terrace is not renovated. It is possible to remove the surrounding hedge to get an even better view of the sea. Really good location, the views and great potential.

It is approx. 900 meters down to Carvajal beach, which takes a couple of minutes by car, and here are also facilities such as petrol stations, shops and restaurants. The popular beach restaurant La Cubana is within walking distance.
