Fantastic purchase opportunity in Los Arqueros Golf

This is one of a kind villa that you could turn into a dream property based on a very moderate investment.

Located in the Los Arqueros gated community, between Marbella and Benahavis, Villa Sunrise is surrounded by amazing golf courses and Los Arqueros Country Club, which provides great restaurants, bawling, fitness etc. The closest commercial area is only 5 minutes away, in Monte Halcones or in San Pedro Alcantara, with all the amenities available within this short distance.

This original Andalusian style villa is distributed over three levels, all connected by an elevator. The street level leads into the garage, ideal for two cars and extra storage, and a spacious entrance hall. The first level hosts the living - dining area, with access to different terraces, the beautiful outdoor spaces and the swimming pool. The kitchen is located on this same floor, as well as a guest toilet and the master bedroom with an en - suite bathroom. It is worth mentioning the high ceilings of the living room and the breathtaking open views over the golf course of Los Arqueros and La Concha mountain. The upper floor is divided between two spacious bedrooms that share one big bathroom, which could easily be split into two separate bathrooms en - suite, one for each bedroom.

The property has been well maintained and will highly benefit from some updating works.
