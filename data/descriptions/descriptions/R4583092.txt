Lovely 3 bedroom townhouse in the small gated complex of Vistazur in Atalaya. This urbanisation is very well maintained and has a communal pool. 
As you entered in the house, you will find a good sized kitchen, which could be easily turned into an open plan kitchen over the living room. 
The living room is spacious and very cozy with its fireplace. From there you will have access to a beautiful garden with the barbecue area. 
On the first floor, there are three good sized bedrooms. The master bedroom as an ensuite bathroom, fitted wardrobes and a nice south facing terrace. The other two bedrooms shared a terrace overlooking the pretty garden.
In terms of parking, there is a garage for one car and 2 outside parking spaces. This urbanization is very well maintained and has a communal swimming pool. 
This property gots lots of potential to be a perfect family and/or holiday home. 
Viewings highly recommended.
