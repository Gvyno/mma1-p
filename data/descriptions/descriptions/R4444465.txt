Fully furnished southwest-facing apartment with stunning sea views!

Conveniently located near Marbella's world-famous Golden Mile, this two-bedroom, two-bathroom turnkey apartment is fully furnished and offers coastal living in a prime location.

Fine dining, luxury hotels, and high-end boutiques are all close by – not to mention the beach - making it an ideal home for those seeking the best of Marbella's lifestyle.

One of the property's standout features is the southwest-facing orientation, allowing abundant sun and stunning views of the Mediterranean Sea. Every room is bright and airy, with large windows and floor-to-ceiling sliding glass doors. White marble floors and fresh white walls further amplify the sense of space and light. 

Step out onto the sun-drenched terrace, complete with outdoor storage, a built-in sofa corner, and awnings for shade. The terrace also features a wooden trellis overhead that could be adapted for more permanent cover.

The traditional galley-style kitchen boasts direct access to the terrace so you can enjoy sea views while you cook. Although there is ample space for a breakfast nook, the living room wall could be removed for those seeking a more contemporary open-plan concept. Renovation opportunities abound.

Both bedrooms are generously sized and equipped with built-in wardrobes. The master enjoys its own ensuite.

With its combination of natural light, comfortable interiors, and captivating sea views, this property offers an exceptional opportunity in a prime location.
