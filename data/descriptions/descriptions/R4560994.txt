Traditional Spanish finca located 8 minutes from the centre of Coin with 9,822 m2 of fertile land in terraces, with complete irrigation system from the property's well and irrigation water. The property has several water deposits, 2 of which are covered. The uncovered one could be made into a swimming pool.

There are many mature fruit trees on the land including orange, lemon, mandarin, banana, fig, cherimoya and pomegranate trees, muscatel grape vines and pitaya plants as well as around 70 avocado trees, with room to plant more. There are 2 designated area for vegetables, such as potatoes, onions, peppers and other. Currently the owner has some flowers planted in one of them.

The avocado trees could produce up to approx  6,000 kilos (300 boxes of 20 kilos per box) per year.

As always needed on a Finca, there are several storerooms; one large independent 38m2, another 2 smaller independent and the last, approx. 15m2, is attached to the house.

The 95m2 house is traditional Spanish in need of making it your own on the inside, with the advantage of having a good, sturdy base and structure to work with. There is a country kitchen with fireplace, a lounge, 2 bedrooms and a large bathroom with laundry room.

As all Spanish Fincas, this has a large outside patio, which is covered at present, with barbecue, for outside living.
