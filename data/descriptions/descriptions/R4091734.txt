The main door leads you into a grand entrance hall with double height ceiling. Upstairs is the master bedroom suite with full bathroom, dressing room, very spacious bedroom plus a balcony and a side terrace, both with incredible views. On the main floor there are 3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms and WC. The third bedroom could be used as a guest annex as it has a living room with the bedroom upstairs and doors leading directly out to the terrace.

The main living area is a huge and bright, dual aspect living-dining room with fireplace and leads to the luxurious fitted kitchen with central island, which in turn leads out to the pool and entertaining area.

The lower ground floor has a 96m² basement, large enough for several cars. There is also a machine room housing the technical equipment for the house. There are solar panels which run the underfloor heating, domestic hot water and the pool, depending on the time of year. The property has been built with first class materials and in addition to the underfloor heating, there is hot and cold air-conditioning throughout.
