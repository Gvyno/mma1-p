A very well located townhouse in a gated community in lower Calahonda with easy access to all facilities and amenities.

The property consists of, on the entrance level, entrance hall, guest cloakroom, a recently renovated fully fitted kitchen which is open plan to a large and bright lounge diner with feature fireplace and access to a spacious south facing terrace with gorgeous views over the communal gardens and down to the sea.

Moving upstairs we find a huge master bedroom with fitted wardrobes and dressing area, ensuite bathroom and its own private terrace where the views get even better.

On the ground floor are two more two double bedrooms, also with fitted wardrobes, and another full bathroom as well as an annex shared between both bedrooms that doubles as an office, chill-out area or games room.

The house is presented in first class condition, having been lovingly maintained by the current owner and features marble flooring throughout and lots of storage space.

The community is very well kept with beautiful landscaped gardens and a large outdoor communal pool as well as community parking.

A fabulous property which would make an ideal holiday home or equally great permanent residence.
