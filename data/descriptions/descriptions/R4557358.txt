Charming Andalusian Villa in La Capellania, Benalmadena.
We're excited to present this, 96 sqm, Andalusian-style villa  in the sought-after community of La Capellania, Benalmadena. This villa has a tourist license and you have the option to build a first floor of 96 sqm and get even better sea view. 

Featuring three spacious bedrooms and two bathrooms, this property blends the charm of an Andalusian villa with modern comfort. Resting on a generous plot of 475 sqm, the villa offers privacy and outdoor space.

When entering the villa, you meet the cosy atmosphere with beautiful trees next to one of the terraces. The property benefits from recent renovations over the past few years, ensuring it is ready to welcome you instantly. And then there is the possibility to add a first floor, opening up possibilities for expanded living space and capturing even better sea views.
An outdoor enthusiast's paradise with the stunning pool area and the relaxed environment. Surrounded by the beautiful landscape and view to the Mijas mountain, it provides an idyllic setting for relaxation.

Location is another highlight of this property. The villa is within walking distance to a commercial area with shops and restaurants. And next to the urbanisation is the Higueron Resort that offers premium amenities, such as spa treatments, fitness classes with yoga and pilates, and numerous paddel and tennis courts.


While the beach is a 30-minute walk away, be prepared for a steep climb back. Yet the reward of this hillside location is the beautiful view of the sparkling sea, making worth it. 
Ideal as a family residence or a lucrative rental property, this villa is a great investment in a sought-after location.
