Nice ground floor apartment in a good location in Alhaurín El Grande.

The property has three bedrooms, a bathroom, a spacious living room and a nice kitchen. The property benefits from two private patios, one with direct access from the kitchen and the other from one of the bedrooms.

Good location, good access, public parking near the building. A stone's throw from all the local amenities.
