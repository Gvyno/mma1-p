Impressive penthouse surrounded by more than 300m2 terrace on a first line of the Calanova Golf course with panoramic views, at only 5mn drive from the sandy beach of La Cala de Mijas.
Those are actually 2 separate penthouses of 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms each that has to be put together with a redistribution of the rooms to create a wonderful apartment of 4B / 4B with a spacious living-dining room in the middle and an amazing U shape terrace  around the apartment. They are already connected through the living-room of one of the apartment and a bedroom of the other one as used by the same family. There are obviously 2 independent kitchens, both fully fitted and one with a direct access to the main terrace as most of the rooms. The view from all the rooms is panoramic and spectacular, facing the golf course and the mountain. 
You can choose to change the lay out to create 1 big appartment or leave it as it is to give more independence to the visitors.
The Urbanization offers a nice communal swimming-pool and very well kept gardens. It is sold with 2 underground parking spaces and 2 storage rooms accessible with the elevator.
