Bright and sunny studio flat close to amenities This flat is beautifully presented and ready to move into and enjoy as a holiday or more permanent home for a couple or single person.

Its south facing orientation ensures maximum interior light and its position near the edge of the complex means it has westerly views as well as afternoon sun on the terrace. This studio flat feels really spacious.

The current owners have included a large sofa bed but other owners in the complex have opted to recreate the style of a luxury hotel room. From the sunny terrace there are sliding doors leading into the open plan living/dining/kitchen area.

The bathroom is located close to the entrance door and next to the wardrobes. Located on the first floor of the building, the studio is not far from where you can park your car, but if you prefer not to drive, there are many amenities within walking distance, such as shops, cafes, restaurants, banks, hairdressers, butchers, supermarkets, etc. There is also a popular tennis club nearby and the El Paraiso golf course. The beach is a ten minute walk away via a pedestrian bridge.
