Very spacious house in Las Lagunas in perfect condition, ready to move into.
It is a ground floor building where there are two rooms used as a garage, a total of about 12 cars can fit.
On the first floor we have two floors (which can be easily joined), each with two bedrooms, dining room, living room and two bathrooms, as well as a patio.
The third floor is where we have a fabulous terrace of about 250 m2 with two other rooms, one used as a laundry room and the other, very spacious, as a multipurpose room.
And then we have a solarium of about 40 m2 on the third floor.
The house does not have a garden around it but it is independent and does not pay community fees.
It is located in a rapidly growing area with all kinds of services nearby, with the beach 1,200 m away.
