Recently renovated villa, located in a gated and guarded urbanization, in the Las Brisas Golf area, in Nueva Andalucía, Marbella, with a lot of character and personality.

This villa sits on a plot of almost 1,000 m2, and offers 5 bedrooms, 4 bathrooms and a guest toilet. It is really very bright, with large and numerous windows, with micro-cement and wood floors, exposed stone walls and other nice details of the recent renovation.

Furthermore, on this floor, a bedroom suite, a guest toilet and a storage room.
On the upper floor, a large master bedroom, with wooden ceiling and floor and sea views, with a very large en-suite bathroom with bathtub and shower. Another en-suite bedroom and two other bedrooms that share a bathroom, as well as a large terrace that almost surrounds the floor, with beautiful distant views of the sea and the mountains.

In the garden, we find a raised gazebo for al fresco dining and pleasant barbecues. A swimming pool of generous dimensions and well-cared for plants and trees. A garage space.

The villa is located in a gated community of only 34 individual villas, with a concierge and 24-hour security. Just two minutes from Golf Las Brisas and Aloha Golf and 5 minutes from all the services of Nueva Andalucía.
