Unique opportunity to purchase one of the most special and beautiful villas in the area! Very private, opulent and quality build. Set on a large flat plot with landscaped garden and an inviting swimming pool. Very nice mountain views and also some sea views can be enjoyed from the terraces and the garden. 
Upon entering you are met by an impressive entrance and also a carport and additional parking for at least 5 cars. The house is built over 2 levels and has a very large living room with 6 meters high ceilings. The kitchen and bathrooms are refurbished, fresh and modern. The 2 guest bedrooms are unique duplex mini-apartments with a living area and bathrooms downstairs, and the sleeping area upstairs. The master bedroom occupies the entire upper floor and is enourmous and elegant, it has a triple size master bathroom too, and also its own large solarium terrace.
