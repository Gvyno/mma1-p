In a very desired urbanisation called Girasol luminous nice family home with three bedrooms and 2 bathrooms + toilet. In the living room you have fireplace and covered terrace to enjoy. Small rooftop with a glimpse of the sea too is perfet place to sunbathe. 
Walking distance to all amenities of Los Pacos and several schools close by. Bust stop in front of the urbanisation takes you to Los boliches every 15 minutes. The toilet, master bathroom and kitchen and entrance floor renovated recently with good taste. Subtropical, beatiful garden and big pool heated by solar energy during the winter months. The entire housing building has been painted and current owner has paid it so no extra cost coming to the new owner. Restaurants, supermarkets, bakery, bus stop and everything you can wish for is close by. We have the keys, so do not hesitate to call! Exellent rentability.
