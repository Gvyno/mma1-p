Exquisite country estate with tourist license for 22 guests, comprising the primary residence alongside an independent owner's or caretaker's villa. Positioned at the heart of Andalusia, the estate is ideally located for exploring picturesque locales and major cities such as Málaga, Marbella, Granada, Sevilla, and more. Constructed two decades ago, this Andalusian-style hacienda showcases the finest craftsmanship. While boasting walls as substantial as those of traditional Andalusian cortijos, modern materials with exceptional thermal attributes were employed. The woodwork, crafted entirely from solid wood, is fortified with heavy-duty double glazing to curtail winter heat loss and enhance sun protection during summer. The layout spans two stories, complemented by an additional basement space for utility functions.

The two levels, interlinked by an elevator, are thoughtfully arranged as follows:
First floor: Eight spacious double bedrooms, four of which boast balconies that overlook the courtyard and/or the scenic countryside. The bathrooms exhibit consistent design elements, while the bedrooms showcase diverse color schemes to set them apart. Every room is furnished with modern four-poster beds, whether in double or twin configurations. Each bedroom offers abundant space, luxury, and is sizable enough to incorporate a seating area and a work desk. A linen storage area is conveniently located on this level as well. One level higher is the "Mirador" currently used as atelier.

Ground floor: A grand double-height entryway with an open staircase; a dining room featuring a functional open fireplace; a capacious living room, also with a functional open fireplace; a compact bar; restroom facilities; two bedrooms, each with its own attached bathroom; access to the enclosed internal courtyard and to the covered parking area situated at one side of the residence.

In the basement, a sophisticated Swedish water heating system, a pressurized water setup, a 12,000-liter water reservoir, a wine cellar, a linen storage area, and a multipurpose storage room are housed. Moreover, the gas-fired underfloor heating boiler resides in the basement, accompanied by gas containers stored in a dedicated external chamber.

Externally, the property boasts breathtaking vistas, extending across the countryside to the renowned El Torcal ridges. The meticulously tended gardens surrounding the edifice enhance its allure. Just a short descent below the primary residence, a 16m x 8m swimming pool is nestled, complemented by a structure housing a bar, two restrooms, and the pool's equipment room.
Access to the property is facilitated by an asphalt or concrete road that leads to an impressive tree-lined entrance drive. At the pinnacle of this drive, covered parking space for up to eight cars is augmented by ample additional parking area.
The property is offered for sale in its current state, fully furnished and ready for immediate occupancy. Only the owner's personal belongings and select Persian rugs will be retained prior to the sale.
The main residence is authorized for use as a hotel or a rural retreat, available for complete rental.

The owner's or caretaker's residence is discreetly situated at a short distance, separated by the landscape. Boasting its own entrance drive and parking enclave, the house encompasses an expansive, well-lit living/dining space; a split-level kitchen; three double bedrooms (one with an en-suite bathroom); an additional bathroom; a covered outdoor terrace; a sizable workshop/storage area; and a petite pool. Enveloped by mature gardens, this property guarantees utmost seclusion.
