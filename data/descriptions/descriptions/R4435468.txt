A very special house that I am selling in Ojen, 10 minutes from Marbella.
It is a farm of 6000 meters terraced with good stone walls and very well conditioned. Completely fenced and beautiful views of the sea and mountains.
The house is very well built with double partitions and thermoacoustic insulation in all rooms.
High quality construction materials and decorated and furnished in Ronda rustic style.
The house is 100 meters below and 90 above. It consists of 4 bedrooms and two bathrooms and toilet plus a study-office that could be turned into a fifth bedroom if necessary.
Kitchen and living room with access to a splendid porch in the pool area.
Below we have two dog and chicken houses (45 meters and 21 meters) and at the entrance to the farm a 104-meter garage-warehouse.
It is in an impeccable state of presentation and is sold furnished and equipped with all electrical appliances and decorative elements.
