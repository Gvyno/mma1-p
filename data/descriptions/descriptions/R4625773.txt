Beautiful villa in Alcaidesa, with 220 sqm built and a 118 sqm garage. The total plot size is 600 sqm, there is a similar plot next door also for sale that you could buy for 245.000 Euros, this would be an ideal plot then for a large family home in an unique environment. The house inside is in a modern, funky budda classic style. The ground floor has a lovely living room overlooking the swimming pool, a modern kitchen, dining area, a toilet and one small spare room. The first floor has 4 double bedrooms and 3 bathrooms The house has a parking space in the entrance, garden around the house and swimming pool with views of the sea.
