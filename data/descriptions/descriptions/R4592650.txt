This residence is nestled in one of the most prestigious areas of Marbella's Golden Mile, surrounded by excellent luxury villas and emblematic urbanisations. It forms part of the gated community known as Los Jardines de las Lomas del Marbella Club, which is characterized by its Mediterranean-inspired architecture and is immersed in lush tropical gardens that create a peaceful and private environment.

The location of this property is exceptional, being just a short drive from the luxurious Puente Romano Beach Resort, sunny beaches, the bustling town center and the exclusive enclave of Puerto Banús.

Upon entering, a spacious entrance hall leads into a generous living/dining room that opens onto a second living area with a bathroom, ideal for use as a library or reading room, which is separated by elegant white sliding doors.

From the living room, there is access to the covered terrace which offers a perfect space to relax and enjoy the surroundings. The kitchen, recently renovated in a modern style and fully equipped with top quality appliances, brings a contemporary touch to the property and also has a separate laundry area.

Going up to the upper floor, you find the master bedroom, which includes a large dressing room and a private terrace, a perfect corner to contemplate the views or enjoy a quiet moment outdoors. On this same floor, there are two additional bedrooms, one of which also has its own private terrace, and an additional bathroom.
