NEWLY RENOVATED TOWNHOUSE 170 METERS FROM THE BEACH WITH SEA VIEW 

This bright and charming townhouse has a total area of 84 m2 spread across a delightful 27 m2 terrace with a sea view, a 26,5 m2 kitchen-dining area, a bedroom and a bathroom, as well as a cozy 19 m2 front garden for evening relaxation. 

At the terrace you can enjoy sun from morning till noon as it faces south, and the front garden does the same, just facing north. So you will have a spot all day for sun.

The house is situated in a privileged area among nice restaurants, supermarkets, and shops in Torrequebrada, Benalmádena. The train station is a 10-minute walk away, providing access to Malaga city center, the airport, and Fuengirola. The townhouse is just a 2-minute walk from the beach.

There is a private parking space included with the house, which is part of a small community of 6 other townhouses with no fixed costs.

A perfect vacation home if you're seeking to escape the cold north - enjoy the beach, sun, and the beautiful surroundings. Or, it's a great investment opportunity, as it can be rented out as a vacation home throughout the year with a 10% return on investment.
