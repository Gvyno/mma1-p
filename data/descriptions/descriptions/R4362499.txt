Great investment opportunity with an amazing sea view!
This flat plot, sold with plans and drawings of a beautiful contemporary villa designed and approved by a well-known precedent-creating architect and developer is a unique opportunity for every investor. It has 6 double bedrooms, 5 bathrooms, an elevator, a garage for 3 cars, a garden and swimming pool with views over the Costa del Sol. The plot with plan for the villa is located in a sought after gated community just a 15 minute drive from the airport, 10 minutes from the coast, Mijas Pueblo and Fuengirola and 15 minutes walking distance from two restaurants and a well known, beautiful tennis and padel club. The elderly architect/developer has arranged and paid for all the paperwork and permits and is waiting for a developer to take over. There is nothing comparable on the market at the moment, but research shows that this villa at this location can yield around 1.5 million euros after construction. Short-term rental yields about 3k per week in low season and 5k per week in high season. This plot is located next to another, somewhat larger plot, which also comes with approved drawings and technical calculations of a state-of-the-art villa. In addition, there is a commercial plot without planning permission where a nursing home would fit well, given the demand for these types of facilities. After all, the plots are elevated on a hill with a magnificent view, in the middle of nature but in a gated community for maximum security. Ask for more information about the plots together.
