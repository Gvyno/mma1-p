Completely renovated bright and elegant holiday recidence in fantastic location by the much appreciated Paseo Maritimo. Big community pool is a rare thing to have by the Paseo, so just gets better! Easy access and everything you can dream of just few steps away from this lovely home. If you want everything ready and easy, no hilly walks and just enjoying the beautiful beach of Fuengirola, this is it. No hassle with renovations, just bring your clothes and go to the beach.
