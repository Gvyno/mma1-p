Welcome to this spacious villa with private garden and pool in upper Torreblanca, Fuengirola! 

Located on a cul-de-sac in a quiet residential area next to the dry riverbed between Torreblanca and Los Pacos, this detached house is built on two floors plus a basement with a garage. 

You enter the property either through the private garage in the basement or the main gate and a set of steps take you up to the front door. Entering the house, you are welcomed by a large open entrance hall with the open kitchen on your immediate right and the large living room with dining area. Between the kitchen and the living room is a door leading out to the covered and glassed terrace and the garden. 
The West-facing garden is nicely landscaped and there is a private pool and two terraces, one with a pergola and the other an open terrace, perfect for sunbathing.

On this floor you also have a guest toilet and a bedroom which is currently being used as an office. Upstairs you have the large Master Bedroom with ensuite bathroom, dressing area and large private terrace. There are two more bedrooms sharing a family bathroom on this level. One of the bedrooms has direct access to the back terrace with a jacuzzi and the other one has a fantastic high ceiling. 

The basement has a large private garage and storage room. A great opportunity for a family home in a sought-after area.

Welcome!
