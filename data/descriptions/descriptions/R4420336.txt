Magnificent 2-bedroom corner townhouse in Torreblanca!
This charming house not only has 130 m2 of private garden, but also has TWO roof terraces with stunning views of the majestic mountains of Mijas! Which, if needed, can be closed and converted into one or two more rooms.
Located in a cozy urbanization of only 8 homes in Torreblanca, Fuengirola, this gem is just 10 minutes from the beach, the promenade and all the services you may need. Distributed over four floors, the tour begins on floor 0 with a 55 m2 private garage, a large storage room and a bathroom with shower, from where you directly access the house. Through the indoor stairs, you reach the main floor where you find the entrance to the house through a front patio, to the left a fully equipped independent kitchen and ahead, the living room, bathed with abundant natural light thanks to its large sliding doors that lead to the front terrace and the large private garden. Going up to the next floor, you have two double bedrooms and a full bathroom, both with air conditioning and built-in wardrobes. Crowning this beautiful house, we have on the top floor, not one, but TWO terraces! An eastern one with views of the community pool and another to the west, where you can enjoy the beauty of the mountains and the glow of Mijas at night. This property also has electric blinds in the bedrooms and living room, marble floors, automatic irrigation system and alarm. The complex itself offers a relaxing communal swimming pool and a bus stop, offering free transportation to the bustling city center every 15 minutes. This fantastic house also has tourist license!
