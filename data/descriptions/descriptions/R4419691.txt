This is a great apartment located in Alboran Hills, Manilva. It is sold with a tourist licence in place so for those looking for an investment property, this can be rented out from day 1.There are 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms (one en suite) and a great wrap around terrace large enough for outdoor dining.  Views are of the garden and the surrounding area. The urbanisation has a lovely communal pool and gardens plus a padel court and children´s playground. This apartment really does offer a lot for the money. It is only 200m from the beach which is one of the best in the area. A 5 minute drive will take you to the town of Sabinillas and the  popular marina of La Duquesa. Located at the end of a cul-de-sac there is no road noise to disturb you.
This property would make a fantastic lock up and leave holiday home or an excellent rental property.
Sold with an underground parking space, fully furnished and key ready.
The running costs of this apartment are very low as well. Community fees are €75/month and IBI is €398/year and that includes the rubbish tax as well.
