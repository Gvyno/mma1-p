This unique investment opportunity represents the possibility of creating an exclusive residential enclave in one of the most coveted and strategically located areas. The project, located in a privileged location with direct access to the AP-7 highway and surrounded by essential services such as a Carrefour Express supermarket, pharmacy, and varied gastronomic offering, promises to be a magnet for those looking for a perfect combination of comfort, luxury and privacy.

Backed by a Detail Study initially approved for 12 villas in July 1988, and with half of the project already built and sold, this land offers the perfect canvas to complete a visionary development of 6 additional villas. Each of these properties will stand out for its design, privacy and exclusivity, in the middle of an enviable landscape and within an environment that already houses prestigious developments such as El Higuerón, known for its 5-star hotel and luxury chalets.

The 5083.85m2 plot has a buildable area of 0.2m2/m2, allowing an occupation of 25% of the land. Local regulations favor the construction of buildings with two floors plus a basement, with a minimum separation between homes of 3 meters or half the height of the building, thus ensuring privacy and comfort. Each chalet, with a minimum plot of 785m2, promises to offer an average of 168m2 of living space, configuring an environment of exclusivity and distinction.

The property is offered in its entirety for the construction of these 6 villas, whether isolated, grouped or semi-detached, with an average impact price per villa significantly lower than the current market value in the area. This is an unbeatable opportunity for visionary investors looking to make their mark in the luxury real estate market, offering properties that promise not only an attractive return on investment, but also a legacy of quality and exclusivity.
