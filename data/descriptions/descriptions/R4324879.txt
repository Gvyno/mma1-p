Awesome groundfloor apartment completely reformed. Quirky,  modern, bright and spacious, it is a funny apartment with lots of Little extras. You can park in front of your door in a cul-de-sac road. It has a lovely and well established urbanisation with a gorgeous roman pool. It is south east facing and has a lovely front terrace with a glimp of the sea. The apartment itself is open and very inviting, with a large american kitchen and andalucian built in storage in the living room, plus a large bar and it also has a fireplace!
Then there are two really good sized bedrooms with fitted wardrobes, the two bathrooms share one family bathroom. The property is built in 1988 and recently reformed. Everything has been looked at and has been fixed or renewed, also new aircon just installed. From the second bedroom you have an extra outside patio (the oasis) and here there is a 8M2 prívate store room also included in the price.
Great apartment, good location, very comfortable and ready to move in, the apartment is being rented for holiday rentals in the summer and takes between 600 and 1200 Euros a week, great rental apartment.
Owner now ready to sell as he would like something a little smaller and is ready for a new Project, we are looking for a buyer to purchase the property for after the summer or someone that will respect the holiday rentals that have been booked.
