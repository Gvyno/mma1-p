Exclusive listing!
Lo and behold, I thought I had seen the best views Duquesa could offer...and then I stepped out onto the 80 sqm terrace of this masterpiece.  This 108 sqm refurbished duplex offers two bedrooms and two bathrooms with a frontline location in Fuente de la Duquesa. The views from both floors are breathtaking to put it mildly.
The terrace being South Southwest orientated doesn´t make it any worse. 
In addition the apartment is sold fully furnished, so all you need to do is to move in.  Oh, did I mention that you are within walking distance to the beach, the marina, golf, bars and restaurants? This is a no brainer for you who want plenty of sun and views to die for.
