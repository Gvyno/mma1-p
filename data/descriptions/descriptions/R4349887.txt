Spacious, terraced apartments within a small private and gated building of only 8 apartments.

You will have the impression of living in a villa with its privacy, without the hassle of maintaining it: the community does it.

The homes have been designed to take full advantage of the fabulous, surrounding nature and breathtaking views. Large windows permit wide, open views from the
living-room area, as well as from the two bedrooms, to the fabulous golf valley, the mountains and the sea. Every space is bathed in light.
