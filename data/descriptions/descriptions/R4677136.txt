Unique opportunity for a developer/ investor!

A very spacious 332m2 detached Andalusian style villa on Mijas Golf, one of only a few that has sea views, and sits on a very large plot of 2,290 m2.

There is the opportunity to buy the adjoining plot of 1443 m2 to build another villa for only 130,000 euros.

The villa is in need of some renovation work which is obviously reflected by its very low price.

The villa which has 4 bedrooms and 5 bathrooms is built over 3 floors including a large basement.

You enter the villa via a large Andalucian style patio and parking area. 

From the main entrance there is a large kitchen that has a beautiful breakfast veranda eating area with French doors leading to the garden.

To the right of the entrance hall is a large lounge with an open fire and French doors leading out onto a terrace and the garden.

On this ground floor level are 2 double bedrooms both en-suite and further bedroom and a guest toilet. 

The large luminous master en-suite bedroom is on the first floor. French doors lead out onto a terrace with great south facing views.

From the ground floor you have access to a large basement, with lots of light, and its own full bathroom. 

In the south facing gardens, there is a pool, lawned areas, terraces and a bbq area.

The villa is set away from the road so it is very peaceful and quiet.
