We are proud to bring you this immaculate 2 bed 2 bath apartment in Mijas Golf with incredible views onto the Golf Course and the well manicured gardens of Sitio del Golf.  This apartment has been very clearly loved by its owners, never been rented out and in a pristine condition. Tastefully decorated with luxury furnishings, both inside the apartment and out on the terraces.  The apartment is sold with all the furniture. As you enter the apartment you are welcomed into the lounge dining room area that leads your eye straight out to the terrace with all of its amazing views on display for you to enjoy. The master suite has its own ensuite bathroom that also allows easy access to the terrace. The second bedroom has been cleverly designed in such a way that it makes space for a third bed, for guests with a small child it is ideal. The kitchen is fully fitted and comes with a separate utility room. A terraced area leads out from the kitchen utility and the second bedroom, two terraces to choose from and to follow the sun around all day. The urbanisation offers 5 swimming pools and ample open green areas around the pool to sunbath and stretch out. A underground parking and storage unit come with the apartment. 

Situated just North of Fuengirola nestled into the valley of Mijas.
