Fantastic frontline beach townhouse. The property has great sea views from not only the terrace but also when sitting at your dining table or in the kitchen. The house is very private and offers an entrance with guest toilet, fully fitted kitchen with storage, living-dining room with access to the partly covered terrace. The original master bedroom has been converted into a second lounge and the two smaller bedrooms have been converted into a large master bedroom. Two bathrooms with showers. As the property is located on a corner it has extra windows giving it a lot of extra light. Marble flooring, hot and cold air conditioning. Easy access to the port of Estepona over the new walk path along the beach. Victoria Beach has a communal swimming pool, well maintained gardens and direct access to the beach.
