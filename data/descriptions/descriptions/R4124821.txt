3 bedroom, 2 bathroom Penthouse at Small Oasis, Manilva. The property was delivered last year and has been beautifully furnished for short term rentals. It is South East facing so morning sun. With 84m2 built including the 4,5m2 terrace, this is one of the Frontline 3 bedrooms that offer the most unobstructed views of the sea and mountains that the developer is selling at 257,000 EUR upwards for a first floor, not a penthouse.
