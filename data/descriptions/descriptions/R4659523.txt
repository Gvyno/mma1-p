Corner townhouse with breathtaking sea views.

The house, located in a tranquil area, is divided as follows:
On the ground floor, you'll find the kitchen, a guest toilet, and the living/dining area, leading to a terrace. From here, you have access to the private garden and the communal area with a pool. Part of the garden was originally designed as a parking area and can easily be restored to its original state.
The first floor comprises two bedrooms and two bathrooms (1 en-suite). Additionally, there's a partially covered, extremely spacious terrace on the top floor, offering a stunning view of the Rock of Gibraltar and the African coast. Here, you can enjoy the sun and panoramic sea views all day long. Furthermore, the house features a basement with a generous, flexible space that can be easily converted into two additional bedrooms, as well as a large separate laundry room.

The well-maintained residential complex boasts a beautiful pool, from which you can admire the nice sea views. The beach is only about a 15-minute walk away, while supermarkets, restaurants, and medical facilities are reachable within a few minute drive. The renowned "International School of Sotogrande" is also just a short drive away.
