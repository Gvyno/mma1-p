This traditional village home is located in the lovely village of Yunquera, in the heart of the "Sierra de la Nieves" National Park. The Roman origin and medieval layout make this village very special.

The house has plenty of original features and quirks, which allow you to change the current layout to convert it into a unique living space.

A reform is needed but it has so much potential with 6 bedrooms, storage space, terrace and nice mountain views.
