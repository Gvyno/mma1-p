La Cala de Mijas is at the centre of Mijas Costa and is only 31km from Malaga International Airport. Originally a small fishing village, La Cala has grown over the past 10 – 15 years into a small thriving town but has still maintained its Spanish village appeal which attracts many foreign tourists and residents. La Cala's development has led to a vastly improved infrastructure with the introduction of a health centre and a number of new schools. There is also a golf course. Sitio de Calahonda actually falls in the boundaries of La Cala de Mijas.
