This townhouse in the heart of Alhaurín el Grande sits in a lovely spot, close to all the amenities but adjacant to a park.

Property Details:

This property is very much a blank canvas for someone to put their own stamp on.  The property is in excellent condition and very cared for by the current owner.   The lounge sits to the front of the property and leads to the kitchen which is a good size and feels very light which can be an issue in some townhouses.  The recently upgraded bathroom is also on this level as is a small inner terrace.

At the top of the stairs you will a large room that is currently being used as bedrooms but could also be a second lounge, reading area... lots of options.  The smallest of the 3 bedrooms sits to the front of property with the second bedroom to the rear leading to a small terrace.  

A second staircase leads to a large bedroom at the top of the property... again this could quite easy be converted a winter lounge as it leads directly to the roof solarium.  The current owners do not use the roof solarium, it certaily could be a lovely space with far-reaching views over the town to the mountains.
