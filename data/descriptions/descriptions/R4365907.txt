High-Quality Energy Efficient Villa in a Demanded Area of Mijas
This contemporary villa is located in the municipality of Mijas, one of the most popular destinations in Costa del Sol. The municipality covers an extensive area that extends from the sandy beaches on the coast to the mountains. This fantastic cosmopolitan enclave boasts a pleasantly mild climate throughout the year, convenient road connections, proximity to international Málaga-Costa del Sol Airport, developed infrastructure, endless sports and leisure options including fantastic golf courses and resorts, and, of course, a choice of real estate opportunities.
The newly built villas for sale in Mijas are in a lovely peaceful setting within a sought-after residential neighborhood in the Buenavista area. At the same time the property is close to literally everything, all hustle and bustle of the lively coast is minutes away. The villa offers quick access to the main A-7 Motorway, so all points of interest are within easy reach. The villa is 4 km from the sandy beaches, 4.5 km to the center of the whitewashed Mijas Pueblo, 9 km to the center of the neighboring Fuengirola, 18 km from the Málaga-Costa del Sol Airport, and 35 km to Marbella.
The villa sits within a quiet established community at the foot of the mountain on a plot of almost 700 sqm. The villa features lovely exterior areas with easy-to-maintain gardens and an outdoor pool. Covered and uncovered terraces with fantastic mountain views are natural extensions of the house to fully benefit from the outdoor living experience.
In this project, the developer indeed values the use of the highest quality materials in construction and finishes with the idea to achieve maximum efficiency and maximum economic savings. The bright open-plan interiors of this villa are smartly distributed between 3 levels. The villa will be equipped with a sophisticated air-conditioning system with the lowest energy consumption. The main advantage of this system is the production of hot water for heating, showers, etc. The kitchen will be fully fitted and with top-brand appliances including a dishwasher, microwave, fridge-freezer, extractor hood, induction hood, and oven.
