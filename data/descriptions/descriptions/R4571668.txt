This pristine, recently constructed 3-bedroom penthouse apartment nestled in the magnificent hills of Benahavis is a remarkable discovery. Positioned at the forefront of an orderly development consisting of eight architecturally appealing contemporary white buildings, the penthouse boasts breathtaking views of the lush landscape extending all the way to the Mediterranean.

The contemporary architecture seamlessly incorporates Andalusian elements like terracotta tiled roofs, welcoming nature into the complex. Encircled by meticulously maintained tall hedgerows and numerous palm trees, the vibrancy of the natural surroundings is reflected in the profusion of plants and trees within the development&#039;s grounds.

Spanning two levels, including a marvelous rooftop terrace, the penthouse is crafted in a modern style that maximizes the use of clean lines, double-height ceilings, and expansive floor-to-ceiling windows that lead to glass-fronted terraces. Skillfully merging the interior and exterior spaces, the panoramic views can be enjoyed from various angles within the property.

The open-plan living area, covering 146 m2 plus an expansive 223 m2 of terraces, features a fully-fitted kitchen with windows overlooking the surrounding trees, providing superb panoramic views of the hills and sea. The kitchen is adorned in white with stainless steel appliances, including a spacious American-style fridge and high-quality countertops.

The stunning vistas encompass an array of trees, scattered villas, and La Concha in the distance. From the upper level, the penthouse also overlooks the inviting glistening swimming pool and a poolside bar area.

With three bedrooms and an office, all bathed in natural light, the property exudes a sense of space. The Master bedroom and second bedrooms open onto the terraces and boast contemporary bathrooms. Designed in soft neutrals, the bathroom fittings and fixtures are on trend. The Master bedroom features floor-to-ceiling glass doors on two sides, expanding the room to the spacious terrace and capturing beautiful views beyond.

A solid stone staircase from the main floor terrace leads up to the private rooftop terrace, offering simply breathtaking views of lush greenery and a stretch of turquoise waters.

The property&#039;s design is ideally suited to the year-round alfresco lifestyle available in the resort, with ample outdoor lounge, dining, and terrace spaces, along with barbecue facilities.

Fully air-conditioned with marble floors throughout, the property includes two parking spaces in the underground garage and a spacious storeroom.

Outstanding communal facilities further enhance residents&#039; quality of life, featuring a social club with a restaurant, tennis and paddle courts, an outdoor swimming pool, a spa, and 24-hour security.
