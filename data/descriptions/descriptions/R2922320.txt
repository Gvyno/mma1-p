This lovely property is located just outside El Burgo, in an area of natural beauty approximately 50 minutes from Malaga airport and the coast and 40 minutes from the lakes in Ardarles and El Caminito del Rey in El Chorro making it ideal for rural tourism.
Set in land of around 97,000m2 with  olive trees, almond trees as well as fig, pomegranate and other fruit trees this could bring in an income.
The owner has applied for an OCA code to keep horses so with all that land and fabulous riding in the area this could be a riding centre offering holidays. There are many large barns /outbuildings (one is approx. 100m2) that could be used for tack room, feed storage etc.
Although there is currently no pool there is plenty of space for one.
The house has a pretty rear courtyard patio, so typical of traditional Spanish properties, with a shady seating area and a laundry room. The front of the house has a covered terrace area.
The lower level of the house has an open kitchen with a large Range oven and fitted units and a good sized lounge /diner with open fireplace. There are 2 bedrooms on the ground floor, both have en-suite bathrooms and fitted wardrobes.
Upstairs is another lounge with patio doors onto a terrace with the most amazing views, the lounge has wood beamed ceilings and a wood burner fireplace. There are 2 good sized bedrooms on this floor (one currently used as an office) plus a family bathroom with loft space above.
The property has mains electricity, full gas central heating throughout, a water filter system, well water, and internet.
