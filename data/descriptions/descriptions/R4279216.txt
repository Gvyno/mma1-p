In the heart of the Sierra de Mijas as it passes through Alhaurín de la Torre and two minutes from Mount Jabalcuza, is this incredible house with a unique style and exclusive finish.

Whoever is living in this wonderful Scandinavian-style single-family house, built with imported wood from Iceland, will enjoy all the comforts of living on the Costa del Sol without the pressure of big cities and the typical hustle and bustle of these, since it is located in a natural environment surrounded by mountains, fruit trees, and only 15 minutes from the Mediterranean Sea.

The structure of the main house is on two levels, on the first floor we find a living room, dining room and open kitchen, two spacious and bright bedrooms, a large bathroom, and stairs that lead us to the upper floor where A spacious and beautiful attic with bathroom has been designed, used as a room, play area, storage and from which you can access a fantastic balcony with impressive views of the mountains.

Outside the house, we can enjoy two terraces:
A large main terrace with dining room, living room, games area, which leads directly to a recently built kitchen and barbecue, gardens and swimming pool.
The second terrace invites us to rest, enjoy the landscape and from which we can access a second beautiful wooden house with a bathroom currently used as a guest house.
