A very apartment, located very close to a nice golf course within walking distance, also to paddle courts, fitness, and various restaurants. There are only a few kilometers to the large Myramar center as well as to Fuengirola. The apartment consists of two bedrooms and two bathrooms, super nice kitchen which is open to a cozy living room. There is parking space belonging to the apartment. A lovely large community pool. An apartment that should be seen, located in a nice quiet closed area
