Fantastic three bedroom apartment for sale located in the frontline golf urbanisation of Vista Golf, in Rio Real. Rio Real is a consolidated residential area that is surrounded by golf courses and amenities which means it is just a short drive to reach anything you could ever need! 

This is a 3-bedroom spacious unit. As you enter you are greeted by a large welcome hallway that takes you to three directions. To the left, you will find the well-kept kitchen area with patio. Straight ahead leads to the wonderful living and dining area. Due to the big size, you could easily move the kitchen to the living room and have an extra bedroom where the current kitchen is if wished. From the living area you will reach the master bedroom with en-suite bathroom and access to the terrace. From the master bedroom and living room you have direct access onto a terrace with incredible views over the golf and to the sea. To the right at the entrance you have a corridor with two bedrooms of an excellent size that share one bathroom with access to another terrace on this side.
