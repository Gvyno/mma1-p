A nice rustic style villa,  well located for  either relocation or a holiday home in a pleasant area that is within walking distance to shops, restaurants, schools and the beach.
It's usual to find single storey villas with the possibility to construct  another bedroom and bathroom on top.
There is no pool but  plenty of space to build one.
The villa is laid out as follows:
An considerable sized entrance area, living room with chimney,  large windows and plenty of natural light.
The master bedroom has an en-suite bathroom and it's own dressing area.
Also a  further 2 bedrooms and a bathroom.
The kitchen is full fitted with a large dining area and access to the garden.
This property would be suitable for disabled or wheelchair users due to the extra width of the doors throughout.
