Charming Detached Villa in a village setting

This 4 bedroom, 3 bathroom country home is packed full of charming features and only a short (5 minute) drive to the exclusive Sotogrande. It is located in the village of San Enrique which is nicknamed ""Polo Valley"" due to the number of polo fields and the equestrian community. There are bars, restaurants, wine shops, tobacconist, etc within a 5 minute walk.

The property itself boasts so many original features like exposed wood beams, rustic Andalusian doors, and kitchen, yet is modernised in the bathrooms and with Air Conditioning to give you all the modern comforts. The Facade and exterior is in impeccable condition. Internally the living area is very cosy with a large log burner and a lovely large sitting space.

With 4 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms and a condition that requires little to no refurbishment (unless a more modern kitchen is required), this is a rare property that sits in the country, fully legal (allowing for mortgages as its an urbano plot), and allow easy to access to all that the area offers. This property is also extremely in demand as a rental to the Equestrian community in high season so a great way to make extra money!
