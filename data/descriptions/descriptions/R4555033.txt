An exclusive villa is part of a seven-property development with a Mediterranean character, situated amidst nature between the pine forest and the sea in Calahonda, Mijas. The development is located in a peaceful neighborhood, surrounded by serene detached family homes, only 650 meters away from the beach, with golf courses, supermarkets, and shops just a 10-minute walk away.

This exquisite 293 sqm villa features 4 bedrooms, each with its ensuite, including a master bedroom with magnificent views of the green surroundings. The comfortable, airy living area includes a fully equipped open-plan kitchen, and the large glass doors opening to the garden and pool flood the space with natural light. The basement consists of a multi-purpose room offering many opportunities.

The house is fully customizable inside, and some exterior elements, such as the swimming pool, can absolutely be modified. The building permit is expected by the end of this year, and the delivery will be in 2025.
