Traditional Andalusian style two-storey townhouse located in the historic centre of Coín.

The property is situated in one of the best-known areas of the town, close to shops, restaurants, schools and all amenities. It is distributed as follows:

On the ground floor there is a hall, one double bedroom, living room, dining room, kitchen, utility room and another extra room with access to the patio that would be ideal for an office or another bedroom. There is a pleasant patio from which you can access a terrace.

The top floor comprises a landing, three spacious bedrooms and another full bathroom. This floor could be opened up to enjoy the high ceilings that this house has, thus achieving the sensation of greater visual space.

Although it is in good condition and fully liveable, the property can be reformed or modernised to take advantage of its full potential. It is an ideal property to be used as a large family home or as a small urban hostel-style B&B.

The town of Coín is the capital of the Valle del Guadalhorce region, in the province of Málaga, about 30 minutes from the beautiful beaches of the Costa del Sol and Málaga International Airport (AGP).
