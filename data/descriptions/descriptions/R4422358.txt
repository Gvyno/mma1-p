This spacious  townhouse located in the charming village of Manilva offers an exceptional opportunity. Situated near the center and the picturesque Santa Ana church, this property consists of TWO separate 2-bedroom homes. The ground floor features a patio with a laundry room, storage room, and a lavatory. On the first floor, you'll find a cosy fireplace, an open kitchen and a small balcony.

A spiral staircase leads to the third floor, where a small hall provides access to a large solarium and a covered area with a barbecue – perfect for enjoying the Mediterranean climate and panoramic urban views. The upstairs was renovated just a few years ago, ensuring a comfortable living experience.
