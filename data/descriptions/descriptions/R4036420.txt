Probably the most centrally located detached villa in Marbella. Walking distance to everything, including the beach. Built on one floor, it has a closed and covered garage. Obviously and as can be seen in the photographs, it is in need of refurbishment but the result of the same would turn this jewel in the rough into a real diamond. 

Ideal to live in although it would not be a bad idea to look for profitability by means of holiday rentals and/or future sale once it has been remodelled. 

It is not always and not everywhere possible to enjoy the advantages of living in an independent property in the very centre of the city.
