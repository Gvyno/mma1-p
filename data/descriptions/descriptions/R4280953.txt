Truly a magnificent large villa in the most sought after area in Benalmadena. With 598 m2 livable area and 4.150 m2 mature landscaped garden the property has everything you can wish for.
The architecture is extraordinary, the villa was designed by famous American architect Frank Lloyd Wright´s favourite disciple Mr. Robert Mosher following Mr. Wrights guidelines for "organic architecture". The living area will please even the most critical eye with its double height ceilings and the amazing views over the sea and Benalmadena. All rooms are spacous and the distribution is superb. The construction is of the highest standards imaginable. The villa is built in Andalusian style and in some areas reclaimed/antique building materials have been used which gives the villa a very special touch. The kitchen has been totally refurbished recently and opens up to a wonderful zen style patio. The front terrace offers a fully equipped wet bar and overlooks the garden the pool and amazing views.
This property is truly unique and a must see for the discerning client looking to buy in Benalmadena.
