Are you dreaming of starting your own business in the tourist sector? This traditional Andalusian property offers the possibilities for that, and in addition, the owners are willing to transfer their successful business in property management and pool maintenance to the buyers.

The property is located just a few minutes' drive from the hamlet of Pastelero, part of Villanueva de la Concepcion, only 40 km from Malaga airport and the beaches. In Pastelero, there are two restaurants and a bakery. Villanueva de la Concepcion (with all facilities) is 7 km away, and Almogia is 10 km away. This region is characterized by impressive nature (such as El Torcal) and breathtaking views. Everything exudes tranquility, and that is also the reason why more and more tourists are discovering this region.

The property consists of three residential units. From the patio, you enter the main house with an impressive kitchen, dining room, living room, and three bedrooms. One of the three bedrooms has a walk-in closet and an ensuite bathroom with a walk-in shower, while the other two share a bathroom (with a bathtub).

The property is well-maintained and equipped with air conditioning (hot/cold) in the living room and bedrooms, as well as a wood stove. Currently, there is a passage from one of the bedrooms to a separate apartment with one bedroom, living room, kitchen, bathroom, and a spacious terrace. This apartment can also be accessed from the parking area (with space for 6 cars), allowing guests to bypass the main house.

One floor below is the second apartment with another kitchen, living room, bathroom, and terrace (with a jacuzzi). From this level, you also have access to the lush garden. The impressive view is characteristic of the terraces. Currently, there is no pool, but there is ample space to legally install an above-ground pool.

In addition to the living areas, there are several storage spaces, including the former office at the entrance. The current owners have been running a successful business in pool maintenance for years. There are contracts with 17 homeowners, ensuring a stable source of income. Additionally, they manage the rental and maintenance of another 7 properties. This business can be continued by the new owners of the property if they wish.
