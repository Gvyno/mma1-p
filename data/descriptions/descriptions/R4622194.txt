Lovely detached villa in the sought after area of Marbesa, on the outskirts of Marbella and just  few minutes walk from the beach! The house was originally built in 1994 but has been modernised over the years and has a total constructed area of 249 square meters situated on a plot of 825 square meters. The house is buit on two levels with the upper level being the master bedroom with private bathroom and dressing area. The lower level offers two further bedrooms with a shared bathroom, ample lounge dining area and a fully fitted kitchen and a large terrace with "glass curtains" which can all be opened. Last but not least there is a large driveway and a single car garage.
