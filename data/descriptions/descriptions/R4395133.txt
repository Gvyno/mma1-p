Beautiful detached villa completely refurbished and with an unbeatable location. 

Located just a few meters from the centre of Torremolinos, it is possible to walk to all the services of the city: Post office, supermarkets, shops, bars, restaurants, the train station... Everything is around and the beach can be reached in only 7 minutes walking.

This is a unique property on the market that has everything you need to live comfortably and in a lot of space, both outside and inside. 
The villa has a plot of more than 650m2 and through its independent entrance we arrive at a beautiful and enormous garden that surrounds the entire property. In this outdoor area there is also a private swimming pool and a large covered terrace where you can eat and enjoy the climate of the Costa del Sol. 

The villa has a surface of 304 m2 distributed in only 2 floors, where we are welcomed by a large neoclassical style entrance with a large marble staircase.

On the ground floor: one bedroom (today used as an office), huge living-dining room with fireplace, complete bathroom and large independent kitchen with dining area. 

On the first floor: 3 very spacious double bedrooms all with fitted wardrobes and 2 complete bathrooms (one en suite in the master bedroom). 
One of these bedrooms also has another very large terrace where there is sun all day long.  

There are few properties on the market that have so many good aspects: Brightness, qualities of the materials, impeccable conditions, privacy and spaciousness of the spaces.
This and much more is worth discovering with your eyes!
