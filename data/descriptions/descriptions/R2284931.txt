This imposing cortijo style country residence sits on the top of a hill overlooking some of the most spectacular scenery in Andalucía. It is the ideal location to get away from it all yet still within easy reach of Marbella & Málaga airport, both being around a 30 minute drive away. The main house is built over 3 floors in a marvellous rustic style with wooden beams, windows and terracotta tiles yet comes with central heating & air-conditioning. The house is surrounded by gardens and both covered & open terraces, ideal for outside entertaining at any time of the year. There are numerous outbuildings including a guest house, laundry, storerooms and garages for 4 cars. The land is more than 3 hectares and would be ideal for keeping horses.
