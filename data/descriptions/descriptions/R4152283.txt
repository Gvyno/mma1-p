FANTASTIC BUSINESS/INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY! WE ARE PRIVILEDGED TO OFFER FOR SALE THE BAR AND RESTAURANT KNOWN AS THE FROG IN LAS FAROLAS. THE BUSINESS IS CURRENTLY OPERATIONAL AND PROFITABLE WITH IMMENSE OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPAND AND GROW THE BUSINESS FURTHER. WITHIN A 300m CATCHMENT AREA THERE ARE CURRENTLY IN EXCESS OF OVER 500 NEW HOMES ALREADY IN CONSTRUCTION WITH ADDITIONAL PROJECTS  IN THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY TO FOLLOW SOON.
IT IS ALREADY IN AN EXCELLENT LOCATION IN A POPULAR RESIDENTIAL AREA WITH GOOD ACCESS AND COMMUNICATION LINKS AS IT IS SITUATED LESS THAN 200m FROM THE MAIN A7. THE BUSINESS ITSELF HAS LITTLE COMPETITION IN THE AREA AND IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE LOCAL COMMUNITY  YET STILL WITH THE ABILITY TO CAPITALISE FURTHER ON TURNOVER THROUGH INCREASED OPENING HOURS OR DIVERSIFYING THE BUSINESS OFFERING,PERHAPS WITH A MINI-MARKET OR SIMILAR.
THE PREMISES BRIEFLY COMPRISE OF 3 COMMERCIAL UNITS, TWO OF WHICH FORM THE BAR AND RESTAURANT. THESE ARE DISTRIBUTED AS A COMMERCIAL KITCHEN, CUSTOMER TOILETS (DISABILITY COMPLIANT), FULL BAR AREA, INTERIOR SEATING, COVERED TERRACE AND A LARGE SUNNY EXTERIOR TERRACE. THE THIRD UNIT IS CURRENTLY USED AS A VERY LARGE STORAGE AREA, HOWEVER, THIS WAS UTILISED SOME YEARS BACK BY A PREVIOUS OWNER AS A MINI-MARKET AND REPRESENTS A SUBSTANTIAL AREA FOR BUSINESS EXPANSION EITHER THROUGH DIVERSIFCATION OR TO PROVIDE MORE COVERS FOR THE BAR/RESTAURANT.
IT IS RARE FOR SUCH BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES TO COME TO MARKET AND THIS IS A RELUCTANT SALE BY THE CURRENT OWNERS. THIS IS WITHOUT DOUBT A SUPERB OPPORTUNITY TO ACQUIRE A FREEHOLD GOING CONCERN WITH SIGNIFICANT IMMEDIATE GROWTH POTENTIAL ASWELL AS HAVING A DEFINITE INCREASE TO CONSUMER NUMBERS IN THE IMMEDIATE VICINTY OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTHS AND BEYOND.
