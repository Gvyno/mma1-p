Finca "El Auryn"
Stunning "Southern Andalusian Cortijo". Designed by a well known  Sevillian Architect-
 This Finca needs to be seen in order to be fully appreciated.  Considering all details made inside the house, the size and value of the plot (5.477M2!), the  antiquity of many of its pieces, the villa can and should  be described as "absolutely delightful"!
The idea of "Hotel Bed and Breakfast" could easily  be developed, creating "nest" type bungalows scattered around the farm, keeping the current Casa-Cortijo as the Main Building, as well as assigning it to a"Health clinic", providing it with the services and adequate facilities, in the style of the Buchinguer, Incosol and other existing in the Coast; or as a Geriatric Center. The sky is the limit… (merely 335M2 of the 1.600M2 permitted has been built)
