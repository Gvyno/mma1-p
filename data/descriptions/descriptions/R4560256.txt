Spectacular contemporary and modern style villa built with excellent quality materials. The property is situated in a very popular urbanisation with several supermarkets, paddle tennis courts, restaurants, offering very good access and a short drive to La Trocha shopping centre and the towns of Coín and Alhaurín el Grande.

The villa offers panoramic views and enjoys unparalleled sunsets thanks to its southwest orientation. It is distributed over two floors plus a spectacular roof terrace. The entrance has a bright hall from which the two habitable floors of the property are distributed through a beautiful staircase with stainless steel railings.

On the ground floor we find a spacious living-dining room with very high ceilings, access to a beautiful terrace, a fantastic wood-burning fireplace and air-conditioning. To the left is a large fully fitted kitchen-diner with a utility room and access to lovely terrace. To the right are two double bedrooms and a large marble bathroom with a bathtub.

On the second floor there are 3 more bedrooms and two bathrooms (one en suite). Two of the bedrooms have access to a beautiful and sunny terrace with views of the Guadalhorce valley and the pool. On this floor there is also a huge window that looks like a painting, through which you can enjoy the wonderful daily sunsets.

The plot is completely fenced and has a low maintenance garden with some fruit trees and a pool with views. The villa was built in 2006 with the highest quality materials, in a contemporary-modern style.
