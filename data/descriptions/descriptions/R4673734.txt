Fantastic opportunity to own a ground floor frontline golf apartment in one of the premier golfing
destinations on the Costa del Sol, the 18 hole course Mijas Golf.
This comfortable and tidy apartment is bright and well appointed and features a terrace that leads off the
living room.
There is a fitted kitchen, fitted wardrobes, air conditioning and marble flooring.
The community has immaculately presented communal gardens and two swimming pools. There is also
underground parking and a padel court. Mijas Golf is just 10 minutes drive to Fuengirola.
This would make a fantastic investment whether as a rental investment or a holiday home.Book your
