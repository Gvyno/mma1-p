Very charming finca in need of reform, situated on an amazing plot of land of over 2.000,000m2 with a project to build around 35 - 40 properties on plots of land of 30,000m2 to 40,000m2 each. This incredibly tranquil area offers total peace amongst nature yet is situated only approximately 30 minutes from Malaga airport, the very popular Malaga cultural centre and 50 minutes from Marbella.
The property, which is accessed via a tarmac road has huge potential and should the buyer/investor decide to build the other properties on the plot, the finca could be made into a central Clubhouse for the other villas.
