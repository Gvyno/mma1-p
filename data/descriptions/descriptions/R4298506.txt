Spectacular contemporary design villa in Altos de Puente Romano.
Built in 2020 on a 700 m2 plot, with more than 740 m2 built and distributed over 3 floors.
The ground floor is made up of a beautiful hall, in which one can already directly perceive the good taste with which the interior design was conceived. Very spacious, open and bright, each and every one of the rooms. This leads us to the large living / dining room, an open space with a fireplace, which in turn communicates with the open-plan and fully equipped kitchen. Thanks to its huge windows, it gives the feeling of a lot of space and once open, the exterior merges with the interior.
The main terrace is covered and from it you reach the large pool.
On this same floor there is a double bedroom with bathroom en suite and a guest toilet.
Going to the first floor, which is reached by a beautiful staircase, we have 3 double bedrooms with their respective en-suite bathrooms, the main one also with a dressing room and access to a private terrace, from which to enjoy the wonderful views over the bay. .
The basement is made up of a large multifunctional room, ideal for receiving guests when the weather is not so good. It could also serve as a space for staff or a guest apartment, since it has 1 bedroom as well as a full bathroom.
The magic happens on the roof, which has been definitely designed for the place where the villa is located, La Costa del Sol! A magnificent barbecue space integrated into an outdoor kitchen and on the other hand, a huge jacuzzi with capacity for at least 20 people. Covered parking for 2 cars.
