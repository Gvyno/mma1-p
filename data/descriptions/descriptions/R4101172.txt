One of Marbella's most impressive mansions, built to an extremely high standard. With an ultra private plot perched above the golf and with panoramic views of the coastline from every part of the house, this property must be visited in person to be fully appreciated. The residence has it's own 3 bed guesthouse with private entrance and driveway and pool plus staff quarters separated from the main house. There is a huge wine cellar, 70m2 bunker with bomb proof doors, gymnasium and cinema room and games room, 1 Minute drive to golf, 3 minutes to the beach and 5 minutes to downtown Marbella and 10 minutes from Puente Romano and The Golden mile.  The house has been maintained to the highest standard and with a refurbishment the value would be well over 20 Million.
