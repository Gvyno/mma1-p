Wonderful mansion in the historic centre of Ronda. 

In the centre of the city of Ronda, only a few meters away from the famous "Tajo de Ronda" we find this magnificent house from the beginning of the 20th century.

The house of 519m2 is divided into 3 floors and a large central courtyard from which all the rooms are distributed.

The property consists of a total of 9 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, 2 toilets, a large living room, a large dining room, a kitchen with an office which communicates with the dining room and living room, an office and a smaller living room. 

On the top floor there is a large laundry and storage room which can be converted into another bedroom. 

The terrace has fantastic views of the Sierra de las nieves and the bell tower of the church of Ronda. Panoramic views worthy of a postcard. 

Adjacent to the house is an access to the garage with space for 1 car and storage area. 

The property would benefit from a complete reform and has many possibilities as an investment for rental or as a boutique hotel.
