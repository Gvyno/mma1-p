A delightful holiday or residential home with breathtaking views. This is a unique opportunity to own your own little paradise just 40km from Malaga Airport. The house was originally built in 2007 and has been completely renovated this year to modern standards, including a new kitchen, bathroom, and flooring. It is 45m2 in size and features 1 bedroom, 1 bathroom, and a beautiful, bright living room with a semi-open kitchen. There is air conditioning in the living room and bedroom, as well as a comfortable pellet stove. Security system installed.

Around the house, a waterproof but light-permeable veranda has been built, providing an additional living area of over 35m2. It is relatively easy to create a toilet and shower here since the wagon is located next to the current bathroom of the house. From the covered terrace, you have a breathtaking view of the surrounding olive fields, the white village of Casarabonela, and the mountains in the background. The 31m2 swimming pool enjoys sunlight all day, and multiple lounge areas have been created for you to enjoy the peace and the view.

The property is tastefully furnished and will be very popular among holidaymakers if the future owners decide to use it as a rental property. In addition to the house there is a 10m2 shed with connections for a washer and dryer. The plot covers 1960m2 and is fully fenced. Within this plot, you will find a wooded area with olive trees and various fruit trees. As mentioned, a true paradise at a very short distance from the village. The nearest supermarket is 1.5 km away, as well as various restaurants and other amenities.  The price advertised is unfurnished and without gypsy-wagon.
