***Exclusive listing***
THE GARDEN OF EDEN IS FOR SALE!
'Thou shalt have no other villas before me', as one of the ten commandments states and this, ladies and gentlemen is an opportunity beyond the ordinary. 
One of the large villas in Bahía de Casares is finally on the market, and not just any villa. This is a corner unit with a big plot perfectly located in the heart of one of the most popular and well run communities in the area. Just look at the communal gardens as you enter this paradise.
As if this isn´t good enough for you, listen to the following: 
Four bedrooms, four bathrooms (all en-suite), a beautiful and private garden with a decent sized private pool (there is a communal pool in the area as well), breathtaking views, walking distance to the beach and last but not least, that feeling that strikes you as soon as you enter this gem - You are at home! Two of the bedrooms have separate entrances and can easily be rented, an extra income that, by far, covers the expenses you have on this property.
Should this villa tick all your boxes, do not hesitate to contact us for a viewing, because it will not be on the market for long.
