Beautiful cottage on the outskirts of Estepona, which consists of a large arable land on which are already planted several types of fruit trees endemic to the area such as lemon trees, avocados [4000kg year], loquats, vines, tangerines and oranges.
It is located next to a river which is usually empty but indicates that there is water nearby, so the water is drawn from its own well, although it also has access to community water. The cottage is ideal for a couple or a family with 2 bedrooms, a beautiful bathroom, a large living room connected to the kitchen with windows to the terrace. It has a nice Andalusian style terrace of 35 m2 which could be closed and expand the house and legally as it is registered. The pool is elevated from the ground to avoid getting dirty bugs and leaves on the ground. also has an Argentine grill made to measure. Near the house there is a storage room of 6x4m which can be converted into a separate room or studio.
The land is of very good soil quality so it is very fertile and has little water consumption.
The property is located about 5 min from the beach, stores and about 10 min from Estepona and 15 min from Marbella.
