Keys in the office, very easy visit!

Traditional Andalusian terraced house with terracotta floors and sea views from the ground floor.

The house has a terrace at the entrance, perfect for a small cool chill-out in summer, upon entering we find a distributor that on the right we have the fully equipped kitchen open to the dining room, and in front we go directly to the living room with a fireplace. Both dining room and living room have access to the terrace with stunning views of the sea and which offers the greatest tranquility of being in the area of Benahavis, Monte Mayor.

Through the entrance hall to the left we find the stairs that go up to a landing that gives access to the generous 30m2 master bedroom with a dressing room and a bathroom with separate shower and bathtub. Going down the stairs we find a toilet and a corridor that leads us to a small storage room, a small room for the washing machine and finally a distributor towards the two remaining completely symmetrical bedrooms and both equipped with their own full bathroom, in this distributor we also have an access to the outside that leads to one of the common squares of La Heredia de Monte Mayor.

La Heredia de Monte Mayor is a small community with a communal pool of semi-detached houses in the Commonwealth of the Monte Mayor Alto urbanization.
