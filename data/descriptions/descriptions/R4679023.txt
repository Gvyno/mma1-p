Accessed via electric gates which lead onto a driveway large enough for several vehicles, this wonderful property offers the best of everything.  An impressive hallway leads to an office area, large lounge with fireplace and dining space with patio door access to a large covered terrace, perfect for al fresco dining and relaxing in the shade.  Spacious modern fully fitted kitchen with breakfast bar.  At this floor level we also find a large bedroom suite with dressing area, a further large double bedroom plus children´s bedroom.  All 3 have ensuite bathrooms.  There is also a utility/storage room and guest cloakroom.  Upstairs we find the truly impressive master bedroom suite, with dressing area, ensuite bathroom and private terrace.  There is also a solarium and, from both of these terraces, fabulous views can be enjoyed of the surrounding area, golf course and mountains.  At lower garden/access level we find a double garage with internal access into the house plus a basement/storage area.  The gardens are immaculately maintained with large lawns, subtropical plants and trees, flowers, terraces and, of course, the impressive 36m2 heated pool.
