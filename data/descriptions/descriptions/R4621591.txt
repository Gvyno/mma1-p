Immaculately presented semi-detached 4 bedroom, 3 bathroom townhouse in the heart of La Noria.  From this fabulous property you have an easy, flat walk into the centre of La Cala and to the beautiful 2kms long sandy beach and the boardwalk.  This stunning house is located in a fantastic community of only 36 townhouses that share a lovely communal garden and swimming pool which is open all year round.  Entering the house you have a welcoming lounge with sliding double doors to the kitchen, fitted with Bosch appliances and facing the private front terrace.  Patio doors at the rear of the lounge take you into the covered rear terrace which has glass curtains that open onto the large (approx 45m2) rear terrace.  Here you will find a lovely seating area with fire pit, a bespoke dining table and chairs for up to 10 guests and a sunbathing area.  Back inside the ground floor there is a double bedroom with built in wardrobes and en-suite shower room.  Upstairs you will find three double bedrooms, all with built in wardrobes and the master bedroom with an en-suite bathroom with separate bath and shower and a private terrace.  The two guest bedrooms on this level share a shower room.  From the lounge area you also have a second staircase leading down to the basement which is currently a spacious bar with window for natural light and fresh air.  This room could be made into a family gym, cinema or games room and as there is another shower room on this level, it could easily become a fifth bedroom or teenagers studio apartment.  Completing the basement is a good sized utility room and access to the private garage.  Each level of this fantastic home has independent controls for the hot and cold air conditioning and all main windows and patio doors have electric shutters.  This is definitely one of the best properties in La Cala de Mijas and early viewing is highly recommended.
