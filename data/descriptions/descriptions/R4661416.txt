Excellent housing in Manilva, in a relatively new urbanization. The gated urbanization consists of well-maintained common areas, with two swimming pools, one for adults and one for children.

La vivienda tiene orientación sur oeste, con lo que tiene mucha luz todo el día.

When you enter the property, you will find a fully furnished and equipped kitchen with a sink on your right.

El salón comedor es muy amplio y sale a una stupenda terraza, con vistas a las zonas comunes.

The bedrooms are very spacious and very bright.

It stands out for its location, because it is practically new, its brightness, tranquility and it is sold fully furnished ready to enter a living or rent. Its profitability is very high since it can be rented for a long time between 800-1000€ and the vacational income will be between 15,000 - 18,000€ anuales.
