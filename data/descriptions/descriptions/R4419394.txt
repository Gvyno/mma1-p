In lower Torreblanca you will find this gem of an apartment with striking sea view from the lovely terrace.
A spacious hall with space for shoes and outerwear leads to the two full-sized bedrooms and two nicely renovated bathrooms with underfloor heating and wash machine and dryer. The open plan between the living room and kitchen provides a space with natural light from the large windows and the entrance to the terrace. The entire apartment including kitchen and bathroom was renovated in 2021, all floors, ceilings and walls. All windows were replaced five years ago. On the terrace we are treated to a lovely view of the Mediterranean Sea and the quiet pool area. In the kitchen area there is a practical kitchen island with bar stools for those meals you don't want to eat outside. There is also a walk-in storage here. The apartment was renovated in 2021, also kitchen and bathrooms.
The pool area faces the sea and is private and green with palm trees and hibiscus bushes. The pool is available all year. If you want to go down to the beach, restaurants and shops there is a shortcut from the street and you are there in about 10 minutes' walk. 
Private parking space in the garage is included, and for visitors there is a guest parking attached to the residential building.
