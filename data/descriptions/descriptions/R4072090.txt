Location! Opportunity to obtain a light spacious apartment right in the heart of Marbella town in one of the well established buildings of Marbella. No problem with parking as it has underground parking, although a car wont be necessary here. All situated on one floor, the 175 m2 apartment features an entrance hall leading to the large living / dining room leading to the covered terrace. The terrace overlooks the most charming square of Marbella, full of Jacaranda trees, an explosion of purple at the time of flowering. The kitchen is next to the living room and has a separate laundry room. The hallway communicates with the 4 double bedrooms with 3 bathrooms. Two bedrooms have bathrooms en-suite.

The apartment is situated on a corner, on the 3rd floor and although right in the heart of Marbella is rather quiet.  Very near to the Marbella port, the promenade and the beach. The parking space in the communal garage has direct access with the lift.
