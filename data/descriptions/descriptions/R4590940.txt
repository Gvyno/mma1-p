Wonderful penthouse offering a 80m2 wrap around terrace with open sea and golf views! Enjoy breakfast with morning sun, lunch with fantastic sea views and dinner with lowering afternoon sun and evening sunset, overlooking the Gibraltar rock and golf course! The living room is of good size, and the kitchen is fully equipped with all necessary appliances. The sleeping area consists of two bedrooms, with a lot of closet space, both leading to the large terrace. Brand new airco machine, underground parking. The urbanisation is very well kept, built around an outstanding 18-hole golf course, fitted out to play host to the most prestigious tournaments. There is a mini-market a minute away walking, and a great clubhouse with restaurant, also walking distance. Great opportunity!
