Charming house to reform in one of the nicest streets of Marbella Old Town. It has a very Andalusian entrance hallway that leads to an Andalusian patio giving entrance to a lounge/dining area with fireplace, kitchen and another lounge with bedroom and bathroom. On the 2nd floor we have the rest of the  spacious bedrooms and bathrooms and on the 3rd floor we have 2 large roof top terraces overlooking the Old town.
