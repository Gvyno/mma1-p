Fantastic corner plot located in one of the most exclusive urbanizations of Mijas, Buena Vista

Quiet area surrounded by a very wooded environment and very well maintained.

The plot has an area of ​​700 m2, with a buildable area of ​​0.26 m2t/m2s, which gives it a constructed area more than appropriate for a detached detached house. Area with a very advanced degree of development in which today a multitude of contemporary and avant-garde style single-family homes are being completed. A few minutes from the connection of the A7 with the connection to the Higuerón Reserve, and to the North, via Osunillas, a few minutes from Mijas Pueblo.

Its hillside layout provides unbeatable views, expanding the cone of vision from the sea to the Sierra Mijeña itself.

Beautiful mountain views, facing south west.

Excellent opportunity!!
