A charming house built over three levels, on an elevated site. The far reaching views to the mountains are impressive.

The top level is double height which makes the living rooms very imposing.

The second level has the three bedroom suites, and the lowest level is games rooms which can readily be altered to offer more bedrooms. This level has access to the garden level with its swimming pool.

There is a lift to all floors.

The price has recently been reduced for a quick sale. This villa has the lowest advertised price on La Zagaleta.
