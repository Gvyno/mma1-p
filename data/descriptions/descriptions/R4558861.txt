DETACHED VILLA AT THE PRICE OF AN APARTMENT! Good opportunity to buy a charming detached villa (to be renovated) close to Arroyo de La Miel center. This villa has two bedrooms, one bathroom, an independant kitchen, a living/dining room opening to the garden on the back of the house and another room that can be used as well as a living room or dining room. There is enough space to build a small swimming pool. Close up garage for one car and enough room to put another car inside the property. Very quiet area. Owners want to sell quickly. Will not stay long on the market! Charming little villa with lot of potential so if you prefer to buy a house than an apartment, don't miss this opportunity!!
