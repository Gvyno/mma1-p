Welcome to Casa Domingo. 
Casa Domingo is located in the exclusive urbanization of Valtocado which is known for its amazing views and relaxing lifestyle in the middle of nature. 

The villa is of typical Spanish design with northern European influences on the inside. 

Located  at the end of a quiet cull de sac, Casa Domingo offers 5 Bedrooms and 4 bathrooms, of which 3 are ensuite. 
Entering the house we find a bright, modern and big kitchen and a very spacious, bright living room with big sliding windows to make the most of the amazing panoramic views.
On this level, we also find the master bedroom with an ensuite bathroom and a guest toilet close to the entrance of the house. 

One level down, we find a storage room neatly packed away under the stairs. 
Here you can find 4 bedrooms with direct access to the terraces. 
1 of the bedrooms is an independent bedroom with an en-suite that cannot be accessed from within the house. 
This bedroom would be perfect to use as a guest room, holiday rental or for a caretaker. 

The pool and extensive gardens do not take away the view and can be used in full privacy. 
Casa Domingo is surrounded by trees, which makes sure the house has full privacy. It is located in the middle of nature, and yet only a short drive down to the coast.
