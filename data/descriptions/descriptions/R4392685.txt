Traditional family holiday home in heart of El Paraiso, walking distance to all amenities

This much loved property has been extended over the years to accommodate a growing family. Originally built as a three bedroom, two bathroom property, the owners have added two extra bedrooms perfect for children. 

With options for parking right outside the door, this home from home is ideal for multi generational holidays as it's very easy to access all the amenities in Benavista by foot, as well as the beach (via footbridge), supermarkets and sports facilities. 

As you enter through the front door, the bright interior is very welcoming and has a lovely ambience. The open plan living and dining area has its own fireplace and leads to a galley kitchen from where you can access the interior patio courtyard. Also on this level is a large double bedroom with a jack and jill bathroom and a twin bedroom. 

Upstairs are two generously proportioned double bedrooms. The master has its own private terrace from where you can enjoy views across the local area and to the Mediterranean beyond. The second double bedroom on this floor has access to a balcony overlooking the private courtyard below. From the family bathroom on this level you can also access a single bedroom.

The complex is in the early stages of adding a pool to the community gardens. Plan included with pictures. 

This property is one that has to be seen in order to appreciate its flexibility and potential.
