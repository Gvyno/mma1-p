Charming residence in central Fuengirola

Do you want to live centrally but still have lush greenery and chirping birds outside your window?

We are pleased to be able to offer this fine, bright and spacious property located in the increasingly popular neighbourhood of Los Boliches.
Excellent location within 5 minutes walking distance to the beach and large grocery stores. Since you are in the town, all other facilities such as restaurants, pharmacies etc. are just around the corner. 
A significant advantage is the proximity to the Los Boliches train station, within 7-8 minutes' walking distance. The commuter train takes you to Malaga airport in 30 minutes or further to Malaga city centre.
The apartment has two airy bedrooms, a large living room and a well-equipped open-plan kitchen. The master bedroom has a bathroom ensuite.
The two bathrooms were completely renovated with exclusive materials just months ago. Other new things are the air conditioning, water heater, washing machine/tumble dryer, induction hob and an ingenious curtain solution for the terrace.
The kitchen was renovated a few years ago and had, among other things, a spacious fridge/freezer with double doors and a wine cooler. 
Beside the kitchen is a separate laundry room.
The spacious south-oriented terrace has a beautiful and open view over Rosario Park.
The courtyard has a fenced parking lot, and owners can access a communal pool.
The home is sold fully furnished and with all kitchen equipment. Everything is new.
