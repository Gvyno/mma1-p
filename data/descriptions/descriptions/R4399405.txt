2 beautiful rural houses with 1 pool, private water source, AFO and a plot of over 46000 m2.
In the mountain area "Tres Cruzes" about 15 minutes away from Alora Pueblo, we offer these two rural houses.
Both properties have great potential and phenomenal views over the mountain area. The access is partly unpaved and the road to the houses is relatively steep. With some modifications and a small budget, an excellent access road can be constructed. 
This property offers a good opportunity for a business in the tourism sector! 
The newest house is at the top of the mountain, has a spacious bedroom, a bathroom, large living room with kitchen. Of particular note is the large window in the living room with breathtaking views!
Adjacent to the first house is the spacious terrace and swimming pool. Here are several possibilities to enjoy the Spanish climate and a bbq should not be missed.
Below the pool is a very large room that is currently used as a garage but could also be converted into accommodation. There is a bathroom installation and the space has independent access.

The second house is lower on the plot. It is a characteristic house that, with some minor modifications, has a historic atmosphere. A characteristic house with bathroom, kitchen, large living room and three bedrooms.  In a concept as holiday accommodation, this house can be used as a private residence.

The houses are connected to electricity, internet is available and a private well provides the water supply.
An AFO has been applied for on this property. The procedure will be taken care of by the seller (including new fossa septica).
