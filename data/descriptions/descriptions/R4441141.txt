Rare opportunity to purchase a  traditional style villa which has been reformed to a very high standard. Located only a couple of minutes walk to the beach and only a couple more to the village center. 
 The house is situated on a low maintenance flat plot which is very private. Numerous terraces and a private pool allow you to make the most of the climate.  The current owners have undertaken a major reform of the property including a large modern kitchen. Three of the four bedrooms are en-suite and there is the ability to convert to a 5 bedroom 5 bathroom property if required. The en-suite bedrooms are located on the first floor and two of these have access to a sunny south facing terrace which has excellent sea-views. This would make an excellent family home or lucrative rental property due to its great location.
