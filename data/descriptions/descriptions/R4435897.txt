Townhouse in good condition, as it has not been used only as a holiday home.
All floors and bathroom tiling have been refurbished.
It has a magnificent south-west facing terrace where you can enjoy the sun from mid-morning until sunset.
With the advantage of being able to park right in front of the entrance of the house as it has a private parking with gate.
The complex has a communal swimming pool surrounded by garden.
Located in an urbanisation with 24h security, video cameras in the streets, transport for residents (the tram); a few minutes walking distance to a small shopping centre with Carrefour supermarket, cafes, pizzeria, laundry, pharmacy,... and also to the Sport Club in the urbanisation.
And less than 5 minutes drive to the motorway, Benalmadena Pueblo, Carvajal train station and the beach.
Ideal as a family home.
