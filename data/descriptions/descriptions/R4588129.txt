La Mairena, set in the stunning landscape of Costa del Sol, presents a unique opportunity. El Vicario, one of the most sought-after apartment complexes on the mountain, offers a southeast-facing 2-bedroom penthouse in La Mairena with awe-inspiring panoramic views. This property is situated in El Vicario, an attractive residential complex just a 6-minute drive from Marbella East's beaches, arguably the best shoreline on the Costa del Sol.

The apartment is accessible via a single flight of external stairs (note: there is no lift). Upon entering, you're welcomed into a hallway leading to a spacious living room on the left and a kitchen on the right. The kitchen, overlooking the rear of the complex and its designated parking, features a separate utility room. While it could benefit from an update, it's currently functional and well-lit.

The living and dining area is open and luminous, boasting a large window on one wall and patio doors on another, opening onto an expansive terrace. This terrace offers stunning, unobstructed views of the countryside stretching to the coast and as far as Benalmadena Pueblo, and is perfect for alfresco dining.
