The plot is well located and well positioned within the Puerto Romano community within the El Padron/Reinoso district, a short drive to Estepona town centre.

Puerto Romano is also a few minutes&#039; drive from Laguna Village and the beach.

Currently the plot is within an unconsolidated zone for planning purposes, however the community has recently agreed consolidation plans to include infrastructure and roads to bring the community within the town plan, the cost of which is included in the sale price.

Construction is subject to the correct planning proposal and permissions however any future house can be approximately 250 square metres built.
