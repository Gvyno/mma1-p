Now your 3 bedroom top floor apartment in Los Boliches!
Are you tired of the same boring style buildings? Well, we've got something exciting for you! Introducing this one-of-a-kind apartment that's hitting the market like a shooting star! This property has gone through a total makeover. We're talking brand-spanking-new electric, plumbing, and even PVC Cortizo brand! But wait, there's more! Say goodbye to pesky community fees, so picture this: a charming Andalusian house divided into two properties. You'll be on the first floor, just a short climb of 12 steps! Think of it as a built-in gym dayli session! In addition, in your new home you can get ready to soak up the sun on the shared rooftop terrace. It's like having your very own slice of paradise, with a BBQ area and a shared storage space for hiding all your christmas decorations!
Inside, you'll find 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. The kitchen is so spacious and well-equipped that even a Michelin star cook would be impressed! The master bedroom comes with its own ensuite and a direct gateway to the terrace. The living area is large enough to host a dance party (we won't tell your neighbours) and opens up to a south-facing terrace where you can just relax and chill out. Another good news is there is a new park comming on, just a leisurely 10-minute stroll away. Imagine playing paddle courts, football, volleyball, and more. It's like having your own sports complex nearby! And hey, they're even adding another park behind El Palacio de la Paz, so there'll be no shortage of green spaces and free parking. Who says you can't have it all? Located in a quiet, residential area with all amenities at your doorstep. Excellent highway access. Walking distance to everything you need. A short 17-minute walk to Fuengirola Centre. Only a 12-minute jaunt to the beach following the sound of waves... Oh, did we mention the easy and free parking at the recinto ferial? It's practically a jump away from the property.
