Fantastic finca on the outskirts of Estepona

5 minutes from the center of Estepona, we find this wonderful finca of approximately 5,000m2.

The property has a rectangular shape with a very slight slope and mostly planted with fruit trees. 

The plot has two constructions, one as a house and the other for storage. There is also a pool that serves both as a water reservoir and for bathing. 

Its location is on a high position and enjoys panoramic views of the strait.
