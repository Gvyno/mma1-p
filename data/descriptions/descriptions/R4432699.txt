We present this wonderful Villa with Andalusian style, with 3 different spaces, a house with two floors, which could be independent from each other and an independent apartment.
The lower part of the house consists of two bedrooms, one of them with an en-suite bathroom and shower, and another with a bathtub, as well as a spacious living room with electric blinds and a huge kitchen with a pantry.
On the second floor, which is accessed from the outside by stairs and can be independent, we find a terrace with beautiful views of the sea and the mountains as well as two more bedrooms and a bathroom with a bathtub, all rooms with built-in wardrobes.
And an apartment next to the own pool with kitchen and bathroom with shower.
We can also enjoy a garden with fruit trees, a private pool with a purifier, a garage with space for 5 cars and solar panels for water.
From the best areas between Torremolinos and Churriana you can live peacefully and enjoy privileged views
