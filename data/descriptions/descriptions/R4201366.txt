Charming 2 bedroom semi-detached house in the breathtaking village of Benahavís, surrounded by mountains and set just above the Guadalmina River.   The house is built on a 180m2 plot giving it plenty of outside space including private parking and wrap around terrace. On the groundfloor we have a fully equipped, bright kitchen overlooking the south facing terrace, guest w.c. & a spacious living-dining room seperated by a few steps making the dining room feel more like an independent area.  The living room exits onto a north facing terrace.  Upstairs is the master suite with dressing room and another bedroom with dressing room and family bathroom. The upstairs terrace was converted into a possible third bedroom although it's entrance is through the second bedroom therefore becoming an ideal dressing room. 
The property is within walking distance to all amenities including local shops, bars & restaurants, sports facilities, children's parks and more. 

This property has huge potential and the options to renovate and extend are endless!
