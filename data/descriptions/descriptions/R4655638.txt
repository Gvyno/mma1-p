Townhouse in the heart of Arroyo de la Miel, ideal for families who need a cozy place close to all the services that the town offers. The home is made up of two well-used and spacious floors. At the entrance we would find a large living room, a bathroom, the incredibly spacious kitchen, with access to an Andalusian patio where we will delight in the tranquility and a barbecue to receive friends or family and enjoy the climate of the Costa del Sol. Climbing the stairs and above them a small storage room and the division of the three rooms. The main one with balcony and built-in wardrobe. And of course a second bathroom. The entire property is very bright, well maintained and with a good distribution. The most notable thing is the proximity of schools, supermarkets and medical centers, which makes this property an ideal investment for anyone.
