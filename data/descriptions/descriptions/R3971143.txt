. GARDEN

This unique property in Casarabonela is actually TWO properties with two separate entrances. One is a two bedroom house with the most amazing views and the other is currently being used as a garden and storage space. This area could be built on or left as a garden, a real rarity in a townhouse. 

The property is located in the centre of the village, a short walk from bars and shops. Casarabonela is located at the foothills of Sierra Prieta, part of the Sierra de las Nieves. The air is clean and the views are stunning, due to the elevated position of the village. It is an ideal base for outdoor- and nature lovers. Hiking, biking, horse riding or just a walk through the mountains and forest, with views over the Guadalhorce valley and even the ocean, are the perfect way to relax and enjoy the peace and quietness of the beautiful surroundings. 

Walking through the narrow whitewashed streets, you will discover the Moorish soul, combined with Christian elements and Roman remains. The village has a central church and many plazas and outside terraces where you can enjoy sunshine, local tapas and a drink. Also at night you can join the locals for a drink in one of the bars.
