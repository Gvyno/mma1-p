Lovely single level penthouse with spacious terrace close to the village centre of Elviria, just 10 minutes by car to Marbella centre and 30 minutes from Malaga airport. Originally sold as a 3 bedroom unit, this property has been converted to an ample 2 bedroom property but could easily be converted back if desired. The large open terrace faces south and enjoys lovely views to the sea and the surroundings.
