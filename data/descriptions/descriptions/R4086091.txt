This semi-detached house was built with the highest qualities according to the taste of its current owners and following their personal design.

As it is a corner plot, it offers more square meters than most of the houses in this area, with 4 bedrooms, 4 bathrooms, a large living room and a huge basement currently used as a second living room / dining room / kitchen / party room, underground parking, storage room and toilet.

It also offers several outdoor areas: entrance porch, terraces, yard and a large roof terrace with views of the countryside, sea and mountains.

The property is located in the urban center of the Cancelada, so the distance to shops, bars and restaurants is a few minutes' walk.
