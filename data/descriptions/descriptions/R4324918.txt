Recently returned to market.
Fully renovated luxury 'loft' style penthouse apartment in the Old Town of Estepona.

This property was lovingly renovated by the current owners only 3 years ago,
No expense was spared in the renovation and is only being sold now as it is surplus to requirements.
The property was designed and renovated maintaining the charm and feel of a Casa Mata that few properties in the Old Town have.
The property features for example a beautiful, original wooden beamed roof that are hard to find now,  that has been renovated and insulated.
The property is officially a 2 bedroom apartment but has been maintained as a stylish 1 bed with an option to have 2 bedrooms, utlizing a concertina door and a Murphy bed comfortably sleeping 4 people as and when required.
Located in a great location just a few metres away from Flower Square, the San Luis market and some 150 m from the beach.
Parking and even a supermarket just a few steps away.

A unique property. Viewing highly recommended.
