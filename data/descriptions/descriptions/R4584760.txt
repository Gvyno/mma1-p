We are pleased to present this bright and spacious apartment with two terraces in the very popular building "Tres Coronas" in the center of Fuengirola.

The living room has an open plan to the kitchen, a large amount of light through the beautiful terrace doors and access to the apartment's largest terrace which is located in the south. The terrace offers a nice view of the garden. Here you can enjoy the sun's rays and if you want some shade, there is an awning set up.
The kitchen is tastefully decorated and equipped with stove, oven, fan, fridge, freezer, dishwasher, washing machine and microwave.
Both bedrooms are spacious and have built-in wardrobes and access to a terrace with a fantastic view of the mountains.
In the hall between the bedrooms there are a few more wardrobes.
There are two bathrooms, one with a shower and one with a bathtub.

Here you live in the middle of Fuengirola close to everything; beach, train station, bus station, shops, restaurants and bars etc.

On the roof there is a common area with a pool that is open all year round.

Possibility to buy a garage space.
