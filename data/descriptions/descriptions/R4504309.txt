This expansive 17,051m² parcel of land presents an exceptional development opportunity on the outskirts of the picturesque village of Benahavís.

Its prime location, characterized by a single main entrance and exit, ensures privacy and tranquility for any prospective project.
Within this generous plot, two villas are nestled.

The main villa, boasting 5 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms, offers easy access to the village center on foot.
It serves as an idyllic retreat for a tranquil family vacation, affording enchanting views of the village and the Ronda mountains.

Crafted in the typical Andalusian style, this house incorporates local wood, Ronda tiles, ancient doors, and indigenous materials.
The tiled kitchen and spacious, well-lit living room, complete with a plasma TV, provide a welcoming ambiance.

While it offers seclusion, it remains just a short stroll away from numerous bars, cafes, and restaurants that Benahavís is renowned for.

The second villa holds the promise of being transformed into a lovely family residence with some final touches.

Both properties benefit from the convenience of being a mere five-minute walk from the town center, ensuring all your daily needs are met just steps from your doorstep.
