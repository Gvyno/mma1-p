New 4-bedroom duplex apartment in the heart of Estepona, 2 minutes walk from the beach.
It was built in 2020, it has never been habitable, it is brand new.
It is on the ground floor in a building of only 6 apartments.
It has 4 bedrooms and 4 bathrooms, open plan living room-dining room-kitchen.
The kitchen pre-installation is ready, but it doesn't  have furniture.
Fantastic opportunity to live in the center, near the beach or for vacation rental.
