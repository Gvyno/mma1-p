Villa with sea views only 500 meters from the beach. The villa is built on one level and is located in the eastern part of Torreblanca, Fuengirola. The home is in need of renovation but has great potential.

The layout today includes entrance hall, a spacious living-dining room with access to a glazed terrace, a spacious kitchen with dining area, separate laundry room, three bedrooms and two bathrooms with shower.

In front of the villa is a large paved courtyard with garage, carport and space to park additional cars. At the back of the house is the private pool and terraces well protected from view and one step down is a lovely orchard. From the terraces and the living room you have a nice view of the sea.
