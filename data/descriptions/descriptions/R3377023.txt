Complete privacy and TRANQUILITY

. Perfect spot for a retreat
. Disconnect ......

Tucked away between low hills, this finca takes the word "hideaway" to its highest level. 

Though there are some neighbours in the same, small valley, and Alora is only a 10 minute (slow) drive away via a track,
the overal feel is one of delicious remoteness and complete disconnection from the hustle and bustle. 

With the origins being built in 1955, this property has got the First Occupation License. 
Today the house has got a log fire, AC and even solar panels. 
The water comes from an own well. 

At the back of the house, the land is hilly and sometimes steep, protecting you against wind. 
The house itself sits on a very spacious, flat platform. Which then gently slopes towards the track. 

Alora is a large large and typical Spanish village, with over 14,000 inhabitants, is a perfect base for exploring different places and discovering beautiful nature. The town is nestled between three large rocks and crowned by the beautiful ruins of an old Arab caste. The views from the terrace in front of this castle are exceptional! 

The village has a unique Andalusian feel, with its steep streets and white washed houses. In between the historical features, like the second oldest church in Spain, there are also a lot of modern facilities, like a medical centre, a cinema, lots of bars, restaurants and supermarkets, a local sports complex and a large public swimming pool.
