NEW ON THE MARKET! This is an exceptional open plan, loft style apartment that feels like a penthouse, but it also feels like a villa with a large upper terrace and also a really large private garden.  The property does not fail to impress with its high ceilings, large windows and high quality finishes.  The owners have recently improved the property with two new bathrooms. The complex is located in an elevated position in La Mairena just above Elviria in East Marbella. Within just a few minutes drive there are restaurants, a popular sports and tennis centre and we are around 10 - 12 minutes drive to the beaches of Elvira.  This is a very special property and we strongly recommend a visit.
