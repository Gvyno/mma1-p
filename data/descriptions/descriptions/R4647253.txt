Refurbished top floor apartment in the established Terrazas del Rodeo urbanisation, located in the popular and convenient El Rodeo part of Nueva Andalucia. From here you have a 10-15 minutes walk down to the sea, 20 minutes walk to Puerto Banus, or a 5-10 minutes walk to the charming village of La Campana. The closest supermarket is a mere 3 minutes walk. So all amenities you would need for a pleasurable holiday stay or permanent residence are close by.
This apartment is westfacing and features a terrace of 54 squere meters with afternoon sun and partial sea views. Half of this terrace is covered and glassed-in so in effect functions as a large living room. Further the apartment has been refurbished with a new open-plan kitchen and new bathrooms. The apartment is sold including an underground garage space and a storage room.  
The community is gated and has lovely tropical gardens, 2 swimming pools, padel court, childrens play ground and concierge services. This apartment is currently one of the most desirable in the complex and well worth a viewing!
