A charming semi-detached house in a small community of just 9 properties nestled in a quiet road in Calahonda. Located just a short 5-minute drive to the beach and amenities including restaurants, bars and no less than five supermarkets with free parking.

Spread across two levels the house features three bedrooms, two full bathrooms, and a guest cloakroom (the master bedroom with its own dressing room and ensuite bathroom).

On the entrance level we find a spacious lounge featuring exposed ceiling beams, leading to a conservatory and an open terrace that offer south-west facing green views over Calahonda. The independent modern kitchen is fully fitted with everything you could need, including instant hot water and a reverse osmosis system for pure drinking water.

Venturing downstairs reveals the sleeping quarters, comprising the three bedrooms and two full bathrooms as well as a large laundry room. Additionally, a generously sized room currently serves as storage and an art studio, providing versatile space for various activities. On this level we also have an enclosed terrace with a private swim spa which is included in the price.

The terraced garden ensures easy maintenance and provides direct access to communal gardens and the well maintained communal pool. The house is equipped with double glazing, hot and cold air-conditioning, and high-speed fiber optic internet to cater to your modern lifestyle needs. A covered car port adds the finishing touch to this exceptional property.

A wonderful holiday home or equally ideal permanent residence which won't be on the market for long.
