We offer this magnificent opportunity for sale both as a home and as an investment.
Located in the heart of Torremolinos, this apartment consists of a bedroom, large living room, bathroom and kitchenette. It has unobstructed views, where you can even see some of the Mediterranean Sea, and is located in the heart of Torremolinos, where going down to the street you have all kinds of businesses, shops, restaurants and the train just a stone's throw away, about 10 minutes walk from the beach.

This apartment is currently being rented on a vacation basis with high occupancy and profitability. It is a fourth floor without an elevator, but the community is considering installing it, since it has recently been installed in another portal of this complex, and right now it only pays €50 per quarter for the community.

Feel free to arrange a visit and come see it before it flies.
