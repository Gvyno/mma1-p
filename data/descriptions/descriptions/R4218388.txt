Lovely 3-bed finca with private pool and a very large plot with fruit trees in Estepona. The property also has a store room which has been fully renovated into a 2-bed apartment. 
The finca is a single-story house with plenty of space both indoors and outdoors. 
The living room is traditional in style and has a fireplace.
The kitchen is independent and fully fitted with appliances. 
There are 3-bedrooms, which share a recently renovated bathroom. 
There is a extra area, which is authorised for a water deposit, this has never been used and could potentially be used to install a fourth bedroom in the main house. 
The extra refurbed store room has a living room, two bedroom and a bathroom with a shower. 
The outdoor space of this finca is stunning: pool and garden areas, a glassed-out terrace, and even plenty of room to park up to 10 cars!! There is plenty of outdoor area perfect for entertaining family or friends while enjoying the fantastic mountain views and the privacy and tranquillity of living in the countryside. At the edge of the gardens, you can find a riverbed, which can come in handy for water. There is a wall installed to avoid flooding. 
There is also a covered terrace area where you would have a lovely chill out area with sofas in order to enjoy the views!
The property is gated, it is sold fully furnished. 
Truly a gem for nature lovers!
