Fantastic location for this 3 bedroom apartment situated in a front line beach complex in Calahonda with beautiful sea views, overlooking the communal pool of the urbanization. The complex has a direct access to the boardwalk and the beach and all the needed amenities are just crossing the road. The apartment offers a fully fitted kitchen open on a small living-room leading the large south facing terrace. 2 of the 3 bedrooms also have access to the terrace and the third one is blind so it could be ocnsider more as an office. The master bedroom has a shower room en suite and there is a second shared bathroom. The building offers elevator, communal parking area for residents, communal living-room and a gym. The bus that can take you to Marbella or Fuengirola is stopping just at the back of the Urbanization so this is a perfect location to spend your holidays if you don't want to drive. The great size terrace (actually the bigger in the residence) is the best of this property offering a marvellous view of the Mediterranean sea.
