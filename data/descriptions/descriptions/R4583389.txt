Fantastic middle floor flat in the renowned La Maestranza complex, an idyllic and sought after location for family holidays due to its security and proximity to Puerto Banús. The newly refurbished property consists of 3 spacious bedrooms and 2 bathrooms, one of them en suite in the master bedroom. The modern open plan kitchen has an island and all top brand appliances. The air conditioning system is also brand new, hot and cold. The property also includes a nice terrace and laundry room. A fantastic opportunity for investment or permanent living.
