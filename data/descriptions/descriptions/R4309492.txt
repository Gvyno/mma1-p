Great southwest facing unit in a well maintained gated urbanisation. Nice sunlight thanks to its orientation and upper floor. Open views to the sea, Los Flamingos golf course and Sierra Bermeja mountains. Spacious interior with a nice layout, and two terraces (covered and open). The development has two infinity pools with panoramic views, padel tennis courts and well maintained gardens. There is a huge private underground parking (53m2), a storage room, and an extra spot destined for a golf buggy, all included in the price. You can walk to the magical 5* Villa Padierna hotel with several restaurants and a 2000m2 spa, and to the Los Flamingos golf course. All amenities such as a commercial area, the beaches of Costalita and beach clubs are 5mn away by car. A must see!
