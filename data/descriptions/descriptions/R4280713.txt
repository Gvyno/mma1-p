PLOT in the beautiful villa urbanisation Valtocado of Mijas, WITH 180 DEGREES SEA VIEWS all over the coast: One of the last plots of 2,190 square meters with wonderful views to the coast of Mijas to Fuengirola. You can build up to 275 m2 (13 % buildability) and with 20 % occupancy of the land, with two floors, maximum height 7m. 

Previous owners had started to build a villa, land has been excavated and foundation put in place but they were not able to finish the project unfortunately. Their project consisted of 4 bedrooms, 3 bathrooms, guest toilet, 275 m2 built plus 258 m2 terraces and 50 m2 pool, just as an example and to show you could build a very modern villa with floor to ceiling windows to enjoy the unbeatable views to the max. The plot offers South orientation to ensure a great sun exposure. The old building license has expired, and a new license has to be applied for.
