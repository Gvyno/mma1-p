Corner townhouse with VERY PRIVATE garden, SEA VIEWS and SOUTH orientation.
The owners have renovated the property making it completely different from similar properties in the area, we could consider it as a small villa.
It is worth nothing the very spacious living room with fireplace and large bullet-proof glass windows, from which you can access the cozy covered terrace and the lush garden, a well equipped and bright kitchen and a fantastic terrace upstairs where you can enjoy the sunset and the views of the sea and Africa mountains.  

Currently it has 2 bedrooms and 2 large bathrooms, a dressing room and a sewing room; but with a little renovation it is possible to recover the 4 bedrooms that the original design had.
It has the advantage of having a stairlift to get the first floor if it is necessary.

It includes a private parking space in the communal car park.

The complex is a gated community with a barrier, which has 3 communal pool areas.
From the garden of this property there is a direct path to 2 of them. 

Located within an urbanisation with 24h security and video surveillance.
Less than 5 minutes drive to shops, to the access to the A-7, to Benalmádena Pueblo, to Carvajal train station and to the beach.

Ideal as a family home.
