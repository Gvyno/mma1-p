URGENT SALE - JUST REDUCED FROM AN ALREADY LOW PRICE -  This plot is an unusually good investment opportunity offering shorter or longer term high potential returns. On the short term when one compares the prices of new modern finished villas in the same immediate area its easy to see that by building a villa here can only be very profitable. This plot is also ideal a longterm investment, because although it is located within a golf course with all the infrastructure this price is very low for the area, and the yearly macro community fees and council tax are extrmely low allowing one to keep the asset for many years while prices in the area increase and availability decreases.  This is a corner villa plot in an established area with some sea and some golf views, with electric and water connections available already on hand just in front of the house. Regarding investment return on a villa this is already a proven area with new villas already being sold at high prices. Not to be confused with rural plots or plots in areas without amenities this corner plot is located at the top of a cul-de-sac with other pavement, great roads and infrastructure already in place.  Located by a popular golf course just a few minutes outside of Estepona Town and Port with the vast array of shops and restaurants.
