This second-floor flat is a beachfront gem located within the La Herradura building. Positioned to face south to east, it offers direct, unobstructed vistas of the beach and the sea, with Puerto Banus just a short stroll away.

The interior comprises a comfortable living and dining area, a well-equipped kitchen, a generously sized master bedroom with an en-suite bathroom, and an additional guest bedroom and bathroom. A highlight of the property is its covered terrace, seamlessly connected to the living space through glass curtains.

The flat also includes a garage, as well as a storage room that can double as a bedroom, complete with an adjoining bathroom and natural light source.

Residents have access to a communal pool and beautifully landscaped gardens, with the added convenience of direct beach access.
