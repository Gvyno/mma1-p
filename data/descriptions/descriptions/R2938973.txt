Fantastic independent house in the center of San Pedro de Alcantara.
The house stands out for its charm, since it is a separate house in the heart of the urban area, it is spread over two floors and has a total of 5 bedrooms.
Located in front of a park and surrounded by shops, educational and sports centers, just 500 meters from the center, 8 minutes by car and 20 minutes from the beach and 7 minutes by car from the Real Club de Golf Guadalmina.
Ideal to combine housing and office, or as a multidisciplinary center.
A property with a lot of charm, many possibilities to adapt it to the use and needs of each one.
Do not forget to visit it!
