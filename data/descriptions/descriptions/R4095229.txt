The restaurant is very well established for over 20 years and has excellent turnover and very good profit and is currently set up to provide forty or fifty covers per service, though is capable of much more.  It has a large, professional standard kitchen with ranges, ovens and extractors.  There is also a separate preparation area and a small terrace for staff.

There is a big bar area, as well as a large internal dining room for winter and covered outside terrace for summer, though both dining rooms could be open at the same time, of course.

The downstairs accommodation comprises a lounge and residential kitchen, with three ensuite bedrooms.  There is a large garden and the property enjoys afternoon sun and wonderful views of the countryside towards Casares village.
