This is a great business opportunity.  The best is to have a look to this lovely area and charming hotel.

Imagine you wake up in the morning, you open the window and let a glorious sun warm up your skin.
Instead of the sound of traffic soothing bird song fills the room. It's time to work. Of course you have to work, like everybody does. But you don't need to take the car or hop on the bus or train spending hours in traffic jams - no, working from home there is none of the noise and stress of the city.

Is this a dream?

Not at all. At least it doesn't have to be one. It can be your home and also your hotel business in the Costa del Sol. Nowadays, and despite the economical crisis, its a successful and 100% profitable enterprise. But its time for the owners t go with pension.
