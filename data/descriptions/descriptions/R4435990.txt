GREAT FOR THE SAAVY INVESTOR!

An amazing opportunity to purchase TWO exquisitely refurbished, two bedroom apartments in the exclusive Ubranization known as "Coto La Serena". This urbanization is nestled in-between the Old Town Estepona and Marbella making its location perfect for vacationers! Both apartments are South facing with stunning sea views, including the cliffs of Gibraltar and the mountains of north Africa! The Urbanization is lush with mature green gardens and a large salt water pool for your guest to enjoy! The beach is a 7 minute easy walk from the doorstep. These units offer everything that your renters will be looking for!

We are selling these apartments as a package deal as they are located on top of each other; on the 2nd and 3rd floors of these gorgeous 3 floor buildings.  As an investment, these two properties present the opportunity for both long term or holiday short term rentals during the high season. Alternatively, choose to live in one and rent out the other and earn a steady passive income! In either scenario the ROI on this investment is extremely favourable.

For the purchase of BOTH apartments: 540,000 euros
Apartment Azul: 265,000 euros (51 sqm) Top Floor
Apartment Menta: 285,000 euros (70 sqm) Second Floor

This is a rare opportunity, so don't miss this one! 

On entering both of these gems, you will feel the light of the Spanish sun entering the large windows that frame the views to the sea. The apartments are newly updated and professionally decorated to create a warm and inviting energy! Each apartment consists of 2 bedrooms and 1 bath, a cozy entertainment area, updated kitchen with a retro-modern feel, a parking space below the entry, and a large terrace for dining and enjoying the relaxing sea views. 

This is an amazing opportunity to claim your piece of the Mediterranean dream! Contact us for more information and a private viewing!
