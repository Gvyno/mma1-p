Unique oportunity to acquire an underground parking space front line beach in Fuengirola, Costa del Sol.
It is set in a four star hotel and has remote control for barrier and parking entrance, plus a security key to access the parking via lift, so it is a secure restricted access.
Parking spaces are very desirable in this area as there are not many fron line buildings with underground parking.
Excellent investment as the value will be always high.
Think in the summer time and how difficult is to park!

Parking Space, Fuengirola, Costa del Sol.
Built 20 m².

Setting : Beachfront, Town, Close To Port, Urbanisation, Front Line Beach Complex.
Condition : Excellent.
