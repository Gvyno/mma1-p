As it currently stands one can only build structures that are related to agricultural and livestock, such as barns, stables, storage units etc….  According to the Seller's architect a boutique / rural hotel is a possibility, however one would have to proceed with a "proyecto de actuación" and present this to the Town Hall and Junta de Andalucia.  There is no 100% guarantee that it would get approval, although, there is a possibility.  

There is the possibility to meet with the Seller's architect as he has connections with the Town Hall.
