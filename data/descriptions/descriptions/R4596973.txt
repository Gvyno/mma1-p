This beautiful 4-bedroom townhouse in Alhaurin el Grande is located in a fantastic central location close to shops, medical centre, bars and a short walk to the Town centre.

Built to very high standards by the current owner, this lovely family home has the same floor tiles throughout the house and classic marble stairs. All the wooden doors, wardrobes, banister and cupboards are made with solid wood and the windows are double glazed soundproof aluminium and Italian wood.

As we enter the main door there is a dining room area which leads to the open lounge with fireplace and open kitchen. Off from here is a courtyard patio and washing room as well as a full bathroom with bath.

The stylish stairs take us to the first floor where there are 4 very good-sized bedrooms and a full bathroom. 2 of these bedrooms are currently used as an office and an additional lounge.

Further stairs take us to the roof terrace which is very ample and enjoys amazing panoramic views of the town and countryside.


The basement is accessed from either the ground floor or the garage door, leading to underground parking and storage space.
This property is ready for the right buyer to just move into. Must be seen to be appreciated.
