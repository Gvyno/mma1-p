Very spacious one bedroom ground floor apartment with direct access to the community gardens and pool area. 

Privately situated in the heart of the complex, this apartment is the perfect place to relax and enjoy your free time while its convenient location means you are just a very short drive away from schools, supermarkets, shops, restaurants and the towns of Benahavis with its gastronomic delights, San Pedro de Alcantara and Estepona.

As soon as you enter the apartment, you can't help but notice the generous proportions which are unusual in a one bedroom apartment. The living room / dining room offers spaces for watching tv, socialising with friends and reading. It leads out on to a private terrace and the beautiful gardens of this, the third phase of the complex. There is one of the three community swimming pools just a few metres away from the terrace. 

The bedroom is on the opposite side of the apartment so maintains an equal temperature all year round. It has a walk in closet and full bathroom adjacent to it. The current owners have chosen not have air conditioning installed but there is pre installation so this would be simple to do. 

The apartment is perfect for a couple looking to spend longer holidays in Spain in an area well known for its golf courses, tennis clubs, beaches and so much more.
